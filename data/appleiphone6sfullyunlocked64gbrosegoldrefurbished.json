It was beautiful, they got everything right. I have never written a review before but had to right so I could totally prove that this phone comes in perfect condition and you can trust this seller. I am so happy with my phone, it works perfectly, nothing is broken. It came with a plastic seal too! The box was extremely dented but did not damage the phone in any way.

It had a screen protector, and the screen was purely scratchless upon taking the plastic screen protector off. Looking at the back, it wasn't in the best condition. It had a small crack near the camera, which didn't affect the camera at all, it was purely cosmetic. It came in the original apple box, but it had an offbrand charger cord and no earbuds. I plugged in my new SIM card (which is AT&amp;T) and it worked right away, and I tested a T-Mobile SIM card which worked as well, so it is at least GSM unlocked.The phone functions perfectly, it was fully unlocked when it came and I had to activate it. The 3D touch works, microphone, camera, and speakers. My only issues with it are the headphone jack which makes a slight clicking sound every couple of seconds when headphones are plugged in (which I'm pretty sure you can clean it to fix the problem), and the home button, which is a little loud.The last issue with the phone is the battery, which I expected not to be the best anyway. If you are having battery issues like me, where it seems like the battery should be lasting longer or it's losing too much battery while it's off, download the Battery Health app and see what percent it's at. Mine is at 79%, which means it has lost 21% of the power it can hold. This isn't much of a big deal, because you can get a battery and a tool kit for a replacement pretty cheap, (10 bucks on WalMart), but be prepared to replace your battery when you buy from here.Overall, it didn't surpass my expectations, it's basically what I expected. I won't be returning it for the crack, as I waited a very long time for this phone and I really can't wait two more weeks for a replacement (I'm a 14 year old so you can see why it would be important).
