But then the problems started: Overheating, random restarts (I keep very little in terms of apps or data directly on the phone, pulling it from the cloud whenever possible to try and mitigate this very issue). Recently however, this phone, which was supposed to be refurbished as new, completely died.I was looking at a website (text-based) when the phone froze, overheated to the point that it was more than a little bit uncomfortable to hold and then blacked out. I let the phone \"charge\" for several hours with no change. I've been told by a repair shop that this something that they cannot fix.This is unacceptable that a phone that costs $500 cannot seem to handle 6 months of regular use (Pandora and GPS while driving, and occasional web browsing while idling at my desk)\n        ", "price": 316.97, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQF1E62AY38XL?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "review_rating": 1}, {"review_date": "2018-03-26", "article": "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Quite Black", "review_helpful_votes": 19, "review_title": "\n        ", "review_body": "Bought this for my wife, who had been using a Galaxy S5 for a few years.

The phone was in excellent condition as promised by the pics and when a small issue arose with the charger they sent me they immediately made things right by issuing a partial refund so that I could purchase another adapter asap. They're very consumer-friendly and they go the extra mile to take care of you.That being said, the Pixel XL itself is a wonderful device. If you have any reservations based on the fact that the phone is nearing two years old, they'll be dispelled once you get it in your hand. The screen is colorful and vibrant with deep blacks that only AMOLED can provide, the 3450mah battery delivers extended on- screen time, stock Android is snappy and responsive, updates come immediately, Android Pie is a nice upgrade over Oreo, 128GB of storage will last you a long time (I have 15 AAA mobile titles installed as well as over 8GB of music and I still have over 100GB remaining), the build quality is excellent and the semi-glass back helps radio reception a great deal. It has wifi calling, VoLTE, and so much more.And I haven't even addressed the camera yet. It's easily one of the best in the business. The Augmented Reality (AR) stickers allow you to place a 3D lifesize Stormtrooper in your livingroom and video him while he interacts with you and tracks your movements. You can put R2D2 in your bathroom, or Pogs in bed with you. It's amazing.You can customize stickers that look just like you and send them via MMS.But the camera; you have to research it for yourself, don't take my word for it. Sometimes I just take the Pixel out on family outings and leave my DSLR at home. It's especially impressive in low light situations where the HDR shines through.Add to that unlimited free cloud storage for all your photos and video, even 4K video.I'm sure I'm leaving out a ton of things about this phone but this review is a bit long already as it is. If you want a fast phone with the latest OS and a pro-level camera than grab the Pixel XL and don't look back. Then have fun chuckling to yourself when you see others with their overpriced Apple or Samsung devices that are still running last year's software.\n        ", "price": 316.97, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PHTDEL1Q2NAQ?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "review_rating": 5}, {"review_date": "2018-09-26", "article": "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Quite Black", "review_helpful_votes": 8, "review_title": "\n        ", "review_body": "Paid under $400 for new unlocked Pixel XL 128gb smartphone.

I thought migrating to Android and Google Pixel would be a massive step up  - in terms of speed of the OS switching between apps (response lag) and in terms of the phone quality itself. It turns out that the Windows OS is superior to Android - way better in fact - but of course no one makes apps for Windows...and Google navigation is great amongst other apps of course. ANyway, the phone is fast, but not lightening fast in terms of switching between apps and opening apps. But it does not frustrate - it is fast enough.The camera is awesome. 5 stars there.The fingerprint scanner is also excellent. The Pixel does not come preloaded with all the junk they load on Samsung, which is great. The S8 may be an object of beauty, but I wanted a phone that does not slow down due to apps overload and software layering. The Pixel has a an excellent build quality. Yes the screen does not curve to the edges, but so what. The phone works well, the signal strength is good. Chrome loads fast and the browser loads pages fast. VOice clarity on the phone is superb. I still need my phone to be a phone, and it does a great job in that area.Would I buy it again? Yes. Note - this phone was shipped to South Africa. It works 100% perfectly on any network here. Loud and clear, and fast on LTE.Note to the shipper - the packing was dismal. The box had no bubblewrap or any cushioning inside it. Very poor packaging. But the phone did arrive on time and DHL provided an awesome service.\n        ", "price": 316.97, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKWLK7425PA2?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "review_rating": 5}], [{"review_date": "2018-09-12", "review_body": "So my first Pixel XL was a refurb (from another seller) and I was very happy with it, however, the GPS quit working.  I was within the return period so I sent it back for a full refund and set out to find another replacement.  I was leery of getting another refurbished but I came across the listing for an \"unlocked\" Pixel XL that Abe's had listed.  It was just slightly more expensive than the one I returned but much to my surprise, the one I received was BRAND NEW in a sealed Original Google Pixel box with all the cables and documents - which my original refurb did not come with.  Everything works great and the whole process of restoring my content from my original Pixel XL to my new one was painless due to the built in backup process that the Pixels have.So, even for an older phone, the Pixel XL is still a great phone. Battery life is stellar, and seems to have improved with the latest version of android \"Pie\".  Features are great and the camera is still better than most.  I had a LG V20 on Verizon but switched to Project Fi, so it wouldn't work.  It had a great camera and some really impressive multimedia features but I really don't miss them with the Pixel.  Battery life on the pixel far surpasses that of the V20.So, thanks Abe's for sending me a great replacement phone!\n        ", "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_title": "\n        ", "article": "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Quite Black", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15NQSAWQ4V8S5?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "price": 316.97}, {"review_date": "2018-10-08", "review_body": "I love everything about this phone even the styling which many reviewers have criticized.

HTC built these phones but Google designed and over looked the whole process. I'm a avid Samsung user for the past 7 years and wanted to get my teeth into something different. Not only that, but also wanted to be apart of yet another technical milestone this phone will create. Upping the game for all other manufacturers to do better. Pros and cons on the phone.Pros:Material is metal and Gorilla Glass 4. Not glass covered so their is some texture so the phone won't fly out of your hands if not in a case.Super fast! This phone is quick, fastest processor in the market now for smart phones. Very silky performance. Runs like a Samsung 7 when animation is turned off.If you get the XL, battery life is amazing. The XL comes with a bigger battery and screen of course. We will see how long it lasts, but for now does not get hot at all, and battery life definitely runs over the 8 hour work day with heavy usage.Works flawlessly with Google Play apps, and Google hardware. Chromecast Ultra is awesome with that device, and I'm excited to match this up with Google Home in the near future.Google Assistant is honestly the best verbal command app I've ever seen. Very responsive,and you do not need to speak to it like it is a robot. Can figure out what you want even though you may get a little tongue tide and give a few extra \"ummms\" and 'aaaa's\" she will still pretty much get you to where your going.Kind of a pro and con. You will have to switch all your cords to the USB C connector. Finally did away with the Mini USB that constantly break all the time.Camera is the best I've seen in any phone. Front and back. Stabilisation makes your movies look professional quality.Unlock button at the rear of the phone, placed where your index finger naturally resides is awesome. Fingerprint scanner is super quick and accurate.Cons:No expandable memory. Highly recommend getting the 128gig. Although when you purchase the phone you have access to the Google Cloud service and can save all your HD and 4k media unlimited. Kinda helps the memory.Not water and dust proof. Never a fan of getting my equipment wet regardless if it is OK too, but nice to have just in case.Expensive as hell! Coming in at the same price as the other big two, but is only with one carrier currently Verizon wireless. Hopefully that will change soon because this phone deserves a unlimited plan. Verizon does not offer, but it's easier to afford financing through a data plan. The pro to this when you purchase a US unlocked phone your avoiding all the BS bloatware from service providers.\n        ", "price": 316.97, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BQ7B10Q4QDDB?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "review_rating": 5}, {"review_date": "2017-05-30", "article": "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Quite Black", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "\n        ", "review_body": "great phone,awesome features.best phone ive ever had.\n        ", "price": 316.97, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1O82JH08G845I?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "review_rating": 5}], [{"review_date": "2018-03-21", "review_body": "Great phone!\n        ", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "\n        ", "article": "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Quite Black", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34CAERCAKBLHB?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "price": 316.97}, {"review_date": "2018-06-01", "review_body": "I HATED this phone it wouldn't hold a charge and when it did charge it took more than a day!!!

While falling far short of perfection, the Pixel XL still sets a very high bar of hardware design and tight software integration for the entire Android ecosystem to aspire to (if not fully exceed).This Google-branded foray into the high-end smartphone battlefield also falls short of being a full-blown iKiller, but it comes mighty close.First, mention must be made of where the Pixel XL fell short of perfection:- Non-user-removable internal batteryWhile the Pixel XL's on-paper specs for active use and standby charge life are very impressive, consumer electronics Lithium-ion batteries suffer irreversible internal damage and loss of calendar life once they are discharged below 50% of their original factory full-charge rating. This is why so many iDevices wind up requiring battery replacement service after ~100-300 full discharge/charge cycles. That's fact, not apocryphal (and true for the majority of consumer electronics Lithium-ion batteries).Consumer electronics Lithium-ion batteries really benefit from being kept topped-off as much as possible (which is one reason that there's a huge after-market for external battery packs and a cottage industry for replacing failed internal batteries). But, no matter how hard one tries, smartphone batteries just wind up becoming discharged below 50%, which then shortens the calendar life of that battery. Then you have to pay, one way or another, sooner, rather than later, for replacement.Another Lithium-ion battery problem is physical shocks delivered to the battery. It not just S*ms*ng G*l*xy N*t* 7s that melt, catch fire and/or explode. Drop/shock ANY Lithium-ion battery hard enough and you have created an electro-chemical time-bomb that can go into internal cascade thermal overload at some unknowable/unpredictable future date/time. No \"safety circuitry\" can stop it, once it starts. Hard physical shocks can induce short-circuiting inside a consumer electronics Lithium-ion battery. So, you should quickly recycle and replace a Lithium-ion battery that has been physically shocked.These are but two VERY COMPELLING REASONS for end-user replaceable internal smartphone batteries. Yet, Google decided against it.- No built-in wireless charging capabilityWhile this is not a must-have, think about how much money Google wants for the Pixel XL and look around and see how many similarly priced smartphones natively support wireless charging. This is a surprising and retro disappointment in the PXL.- No extSDcard slotWhile this is in keeping with Google's long standing refusal to allow for user-expandable device storage, 32Gb of internal device storage is a pittance in the face of storing 4K video and so-called VR content. My existing production smartphone has 32Gb internal storage, which is 48% full, and a user-added 64Gb 95Mb/sec microSDXC card, which is 70% full. (I do run a number of professional network and IT testing tools on that smartphone, many from the extSdCard.) All of this would NEVER fit in 32Gb. And don't forget how much device storage must be kept freely available for full Android OS upgrades/updates.I don't care for cloud storage of personal/sensitive data, period. Even though Google promises free, unlimited, original resolution image/video cloud storage for Pixel customers, that's going to mostly be useless to me. I don't trust Google with much of anything that I can't automatically TNO-encrypt, pre-cloud, and maintain as TNO-encrypted in-cloud. Also, think about the data plan costs of moving high-res images and 4K videos to-and-from the cloud. And how well do you think 4K video streams over LTE? Cloud is not for me. Please, give me an option to fully utilize a fast 256Gb microSDXC on-board expansion card.Google's hob-nailed boot steps down on my neck by continuing to refuse to support high-speed/high-capacity expansion storage. That is kind of EVIL at these high price points in the Android universe.My push back is to use a USB3.1/USB-C external memory card reader with the PXL for literally external SDcard backup storage. Sadly, I can't conveniently run apps from the card reader, but I can keep tons of data backed-up and freely available to me without the vagaries of \"streaming.\" (Just read the horror stories of people who lost way more than they bargained for by placing irreplaceable data in someone else's cloud storage. Yeah, that really does happen.)- The built-in speaker is mono onlyAgain, for the price, look at how many similarly (and even lesser) priced smartphones have built-in stereo speakers.- Only rated IP53 for dust and water splash resistanceSmartphone makers keep playing games with the resistance of their devices to environmental particulates and water damage. While I'm not demanding IP-68 rated full submersibility from Google, as long as smartphones continue to use cheap tin for solder joints and board traces, a phone as expensive as the Pixel XL can and should do better than IP-53. Please, Google, set a better standard for everyone else to match.None of these shortcomings are showstoppers, but they are all disappointing displays of Google's stubborn engineering arrogance/hubris..And now, the MANY THINGS TO REALLY LIKE ABOUT THE PIXEL XL, things that are definitely iSLAMMERS...+ Rapid battery charging, longer runtimes and standby chargeBattery run times and standby charge life will depend on exactly how you use your phone. That said, the paper specs on the Pixel XLs 3450mAH battery are: 32 hrs LTE talk, 14 hrs LTE data, 14 hrs WiFi, 130 hrs music play, 14 hrs video play and 522 hrs standby.I don't personally expect to see these numbers, myself, because of my app loadout and tendency to find myself in areas of marginal to poor LTE signal coverage (inside Faraday-cage-like structures and/or high ambient EM/RF interference); but these numbers are beefy, nonetheless. As long as Nougat (Android 7.1) doesn't serve up any nasty runaway built-in services/processes, the PXL battery should outlast a Nexus 6 doing the same things. My other smartphone, even with its significantly bigger battery, doesn't come close to the PXL's promise.Google claims the PXL can be charged (from O?) to 7 hrs of talk time in 15 minutes. I have to interpolate 7 hrs talk to mean less than 25% of full charge. If charging rates are linear (which they may not be), that would imply a full charge in something over an hour of continuous charging. While I've never fully discharged the Lithium-ion battery in my production smartphone, I know that fully recovering from a 50% discharge takes slightly less than an hour, and that battery, fully charged, is supposed to hold 4900 mAH, which is considerably more than the PXL's 3450 mAH. So, I'm not sure how rapid Google's rapid charging actually is in comparison. In a real world charging test, with WiFi on, LTE/BT/NFC/GPS off, but PXL otherwise in standby, charging from 79% to 100% took 27 minutes.Another thing to keep in mind is that there's more to the safe and sane \"rapid\" charging of Lithium-ion batteries than just the basic dance of balancing voltage, current and internal temperature. The chemistry and physical internal structure of the battery has to specifically support rapid charging, too. Google is keeping totally mum on exactly which Lithium ion chemistry they chose for the Pixel XL's battery. I can say that the phone does not warm up, at all, during charging, very much unlike my other smartphones.I left a fully charged Pixel XL, with an equivalent production loadout of apps, on standby (WiFi off, LTE off, BT/NFC off, GPS off, Airplane mode on) side-by-side with an older smartphone (that also happens to have a much higher mAH battery than the Pixel XL), for nine hours. At the end of this test, the Pixel XL had drained 1% of it's full charge. The other smartphone drained 63% of it's full charge. Part of the Pixel XL's standby performance could be battery chemistry, part of it is definitely the advanced power management of the Snapdragon 821 cpu.+ Bezel-ed 1440v2560 QuadHD AMOLED displayThe AMOLED display is outstanding even in broad daylight. 534 pixels per inch makes for very vivid/rich images. I don't have to shade the Pixel XL's screen to see what it's showing me in broad daylight. I'm also OK with the scratch resistant Gorilla Glass 4 (vs the more allegedly crack resistant Glass 5), because there's a functional bezel surrounding the screen's edges. (My PXL will live inside an Otter Box Defender case, too).I am adamantly pro-bezel for candybar style devices, as long as that bezel is both functional and durable. I'm not mounting the PXL up on a wall. I don't need any smartphone to be a functionally compromised \"work of art.\" My PXL is always going to be in hand or standing by on a custom carry retractable rig or dash mounted. The purpose of a bezel, in my world, is to protect the edges of the glass from damage and prevent unintended screen touches/button presses. Bezels that don't do both are useless to me. Edge-to-edge, bezel-less screen glass really means, to me, more surface area to attract damage and more unintended taps/presses. The bezel on the PXL is AOK by me.+ Android Nougat 7.1, Qualcomm Snapdragon 821+Adreno 530, 4GB RAMPixel XL ships with factory Android 7.1 and keep in mind that Nougat on PXL is a different beast from Nougat on Nexus, and just about anything else, for now.Un-rooted Nougat allows forcing apps to extSdCard so that you may test for yourself whether or not they will run (sans widgets) from extSdCard, by overriding the app's manifest. More power to the End User is a good thing.Surprisingly, there is no real file manager on the PXL's Nougat and Chrome is the only factory installed Internet browser. If you need to setup Microsoft Exchange Server ActiveSync accounts, do *not* disable the Gmail app. Nougat 7.1's Settings | Accounts only lets you setup Google accounts if the Gmail app is disabled. The reasoning behind these decisions by Google eludes me.The Snapdragon 821 is a quad-core CPU, with two full-power and two low-power cores for maximizing performance while also aggressively managing power consumption. The GPU is Adreno 530, 4K and VR capable. RAM is LPDDR4 and absolutely necessary for software to continuously leverage hardware performance. Bravo on all counts.+ Main CameraThe Pixel XL's main camera is a Sony IMX378 12-megapixel image sensor, with photon gulping 1.55micron pixels and a f/2.0 aperture lens. Google's proprietary (and compute intensive) HDR+ technology makes it the fastest image capturing HDR camera available on a smartphone today, across a range of lighting levels. The PXL can shoot 30 fps 4K video (3840x2160) and uses software video image stabilization, rather than optical image stabilization. That software actively reads the Pixel XL's internal gyro-sensor (@200Hz) to rapidly compute adjustments for shakes/jiggles. Fewer physically moving parts is AOK by me.This camera has no optical zoom, only digital zoom. Normally, I'm an optical zoom bigot, but the Pixel XL's 4K-capable alchemy has expanded my opinion of digital zoom. Plus, if I insisted on optical zoom, I can always clamp on an appropriate third-party helper lens.By default, HDR+ is always enabled and the camera essentially always captures frames in video mode. For still photography, 10 of 30 RAW frames captured are then sampled/composited together to produce a final JPEG image. This alchemy of hardware and software synergy develops significantly better images than from any other smartphone that I have used. The PXL takes the fastest and best non-flash, low-light photos of any smartphone that I have owned.There are downsides though. The main cam can only shoot 12.3MP in 4:3 mode. The best you can get in 16:9 is 8.3MP, because you are cropping away some IMX378 sensor data to simulate a widescreen image.In all of the main camera video modes (720p, 1080p and 4K) you do not have granular control over frame rate. Google Camera v4.2.022.135443920 (a Google Play update to factory Nougat 7.1) does allow you to select a pre-determined high frame rate (\"slow motion\") for video on the Pixel XL.Functioning as a GPS-enabled dashcam, the Pixel XL is so good at 1080P night vision that I wish it could project a heads-up display on the windshield. The levels of low-light illumination and contrast are quite remarkable, even with on-coming high beam lights. Everything remains in focus even when traversing pot holes and turns. The only limitation is that the 16x9 landscape video is not wide enough to catch all four corners when stopped at an intersection. An add-on lens will be required to widen the field of view.+ 3.5 mm stereo headset jack, USB-C charging/connectivity portHooray for the stereo headset jack! I deliberately don't use Bluetooth headsets of any kind and have ALWAYS used pro-grade wired headsets with cell phones from Day One, for brain EM/RF safety and conversation privacy.The even bigger deal, for me, is the USB-C charging and connectivity port. USB-C is the unifying data/power port of today and the future. It compliments and exceeds USB 3.1. Plug reversibility means there is no upside-down orientation. USB-C seriously future-proofs the Pixel XL across a wide array of companion devices that support USB-C, DisplayPort 1.3, HDMI 2.0 and/or USB 3.1 protocols. And there are adapter cables for legacy USB. The one thing to be aware of is that improperly terminated USB-C cables can inflict electrical component damage, so make sure you only obtain USB-C cables from reputable makers that properly implement the grounding specs.Because Android implements extSdCard as USB storage, I can use the PXL's USB-C port to connect a USB3.1 compliant, USB-C external memory card reader, which allows for memory card-based local data backup and rapid transfer of bulk data across devices.Google tells me that the PXL's USB-C port is a full implementation, so it is supposed to be able to push 4K video to an external monitor, using an appropriate adapter.+ Google AssistantI personally don't trust Google and I'm far from alone in that.I have always HATED the annoying invasiveness of GoogleNOW and it's all-or-nothing \"privacy\" configurability. Now, we get Google Assistant, which is supposed to be gNOW \"on steroids.\" (Similar/parallel concerns about privacy invasion and information hemorrhage make me equally despise Microsoft's cynical implementation of Cortana on Windows 10.)I don't want/need any corporation placing a digital diaper around my brain pan in a lop-sided trade for el corpo's definition of \"convenience.\" It's bad enough as it is with three-letter-agencies peering into spaces that ought to be private/personal with zero value-add for me.Fortunately, I can go into Nougat's Settings and defang the leaking-to-the-cloud \"features\" in the Google app (trading away OK Google functionality) and Disable or (even better) Uninstall Android Pay, Gmail (with the previously mentioned caveat), Google+, Hangouts, OK Google enrollment, carrier bloatware, etc without \"rooting.\"My privacy matters to me. My thought process is not for Google to reverse engineer. I do use highly effective applications, from non-affiliated vendors, for voice command, stand-alone/off-line navigation, traffic conditions, etc. I also use four different security hardened web browsers on each of my mobile devices. The Pixel XL will be no different (although finding reliable offline voice command is proving to be very tricky). Information about me that begins compartmented in the real world needs to stay that way, until I say otherwise, on a case-by-case basis. One time, blanket permissions are an insult to me. I also try not to put things into the cloud unless I can \"TNO\" encrypt, pre-cloud, and keep it that way in-cloud.The only way that Google Assistant can play a role in my world is if the bulk of the processing happens on-device, local to me, with highly granular permissions on and redactions of personally identifiable meta-data that I'm only then willing to share with Google or anyone else on a case-by-case basis. That and only that is Do-ing No Evil by Me. All of that is do-able, too, but Google just doesn't see fit to.+ 24x7 technical supportDuring my review of the Pixel XL, Google (not Verizon) pushed the ~33MB 05 Oct 2016 Security Update for Nougat 7.1 to my Pixel XL. (My high-end S... N... # is still waiting its 05 Oct Security Update for Marshmallow 6.0.1 from my ALWAYS-LATE-WITH-THE-PATCHES US other carrier.) Again, bravo, Google. Updates should be direct to device from Google for ALL Androids.24x7 TS is a must as there is no PDF User Guide available for the Pixel XL. And, yes, it's really 24x7.The on-line FAQs are quaint. I haven't tried Chat Support. I have called in and not gotten answers to some questions that I've posed (like battery chemistry). And, yes, Google's engineers are working on the Bluetooth pairs, then summarily disconnects software bug.+ Bottom LineI agree with others that the Pixel XL is very expensive, but, at this time, it's hard to find many of the PXL's features and functionality at any other price point. So, if you need what the PXL has to offer, then I do recommend it.\n        ", "review_helpful_votes": 100, "review_title": "\n        ", "article": "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Quite Black", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R195OT7SGJVW3B?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "price": 316.97}, {"review_date": "2018-06-29", "review_body": "After sacrificing my last Google Pixel XL 128 GB to the East River, I have replaced it with a new one.\n        ", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "\n        ", "article": "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Quite Black", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35DNKPR9V86MB?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "price": 316.97}, {"review_date": "2017-12-12", "review_body": "Great phone.

Of the 53 ONE star reviews the Pixel XL received, only 4, that's right, 4 were written by verified buyers. That's 1 verified buyer for every 13 reviews. In total, almost 1/3 of the ONE star reviews (not one from a verified buyer) were by folks who claimed to have paid at least $1,500, to as much as $2,000, for a Google Pixel XL that lists for $990. While another 1/3 of the ONE star reviews were by folks who clearly stated that they HAD NOT PURCHASED the Pixel/Pixel XL and WOULD NOT PURCHASE it because is was too expensive or they didn't like the provider's plan, mostly Verizon, which, in fact, has nothing to do with the cell. (Check their website, Verizon offers the same \"lousy\" plan whether you're buying a Pixel or a Samsung). Conversely, the Pixel/Pixel XL received about 50 FOUR AND FIVE star reviews of which 46 of the 50 or 92% are from verified buyers. That's almost comical.  Only 8% of the ONE star reviews are from verified buyers while 93 % of the FOUR AND FIVE star reviews are from people who made clean, verified purchases through Amazon. Now, who am I supposed to give the greatest weight to? If you adjust the ratings to scrub all the \" One Stars\" attributed to \"not worth the outrageous price\" and the like and spread them evenly across TWO through FIVE Star ratings, then this phone would rate in the 4.2 to 4.3 range instead of 3.6, a 20% difference between make-believe and reality. Yet another unfortunate demonstration that one must read the ONE and TWO star ratings very, very carefully to weed through those left by folks who simply do not know what they are talking about.  Sad, but all to often true. However, as a VERIFIED PURCHASER...After carefully reading all the new product reviews on sites such as CNET, Consumer Reports, The WSJ, and many more, I actually purchased a Pixel XL 128GB. No place, absolutely place I looked, had a list price for a new, 2017 Goggle Pixel XL 128GB Quite Black that exceeded $1,000. My Pixel XL 128GB Quite Black arrived about 10 days ago. I purchased an unlocked U.S. version from a merchant with a 97% 365 day Positive Rating fulfilled through Amazon with an Amazon A to z (doesn't work send it back within 30 days) warranty. I purchased an Universal SIM card from Sprint.  They overnIghted the card to me and the local store installed it and transferred all the data. Total cost to me for the Pixel, SIM card, shipping, and taxes were $997. I am in 7th heaven.The phone is easy to use, has a one to one interface that lets you sync directly with any Windows firmware or software via cable or cloud, 100% drag and drop interface, UNLIMITED FREE cloud storage between ANY model Pixel and Google Cloud. Over 800,000 free/low cost apps. Latest, full featured/experimental Android OS. And anything, anything, that was preloaded at the time of purchase can be used as is, used in the experimental developer mode or dragged into the trash and permanently removed.

In a nutshell, it is the best Android phone on the market today (Nov 2016).  I have owned a Pixel XL, a Nexus 6P, and an iPhone 6S+, and I would rate them in that order (Pixel first, iPhone last).  The hardware across all three seem comparable.  The Pixel XL is noticeably lighter than the Nexus 6P, and it\u2019s a little faster.  But all three are pretty close in terms of performance.  The big differentiator is the software.  The Pixel XL comes with the latest version of Android N, with Google Assistant fully integrated.  Nexus is also great and you can install the Google Assistant.  The iPhone 6S+ is a distant third - iOS has gotten harder to use over the years and Siri just plain sucks.  The Google Assistant has become my goto action on the phone, and it\u2019s 100x better than Siri.Even though companies like Samsung also make good hardware, they just have to load up their phones with a ton of bloatware which is nearly impossible to get rid of.  The very nice thing about \u201cmade by Google\u201d phones is that it comes with the default stock Android operating system without all the additional bloatware that other phone makers add to theirs.  Google also keeps it phones always up to date with the latest version of Android, whereas with other phone makers they often choose not to upgrade because it\u2019s a lot of effort for them.So, the Pixel XL is the latest of the \u201cmade by Google\u201d phones, and it is by far the best Android smartphone out there.  Amazon doesn\u2019t carry the Pixel phone - in fact Amazon won\u2019t carry a lot of the \u201cmade by Google\u201d products because Amazon considers Google a competitor (Google\u2019s Home product competes with Amazon\u2019s Echo, the Nexus tablet competes with the Kindle, etc.).  So as of Nov 2016 you won\u2019t find this phone on Amazon, with the exception that some smaller less-than-reputable companies pre-ordered a number of phones from Google and are now selling through Amazon with an exorbitant markup (~2x the retail price due to the high demand and short supply of these phones).  I purchased my Pixel XL on the google store (store.google.com) at retail for $750+tax USD, that\u2019s probably where you should go if you\u2019re looking to buy one of these.  Many of the reviews for the Pixel XL on Amazon are negative mainly in response to the price-gouging by the smaller resellers, you can ignore those because those reviews have nothing to do with the phone itself (they\u2019re more directed at the companies trying to take consumers for a ride).So what do I like about the Pixel?- It\u2019s fast and responsive, much like the Nexus 6P and iPhone 6S+.- Like the Nexus 6P, the fingerprint scanner is really fast and responsive, and placed in a MUCH better spot than the iPhone 6S+.  It\u2019s where the index finger naturally sits.- I really like the latest Android N software, and I really really like the integrated Google Assistant.- The external reviews made a big deal about the camera - after using it some I have to say it's quite good, even better than the iPhone 6S+ which I thought was already great for a phone camera.  The phone is *much* faster than the Nexus 6P phone (meaning it takes the photo when you tap, not 1 second later), and takes excellent pictures in low light.- The camera app has gotten a lot better - the video recording now has a pause feature, and you can take 4K video!- Battery life is excellent, but again not much difference from the other two (which were also very good).- Like the Nexus 6P, this phone uses a USB-C charger, which means it charges very quickly.  I don't have to charge overnight any more, plugging in once in a while keeps the battery mostly full all the time.- Google keeps its phones always up to date with the latest updates, much like Apple does with its iPhone.What don't I like about the Pixel XL?- The Nexus 6P had stereo speakers (one speaker on the bottom and one on top), whereas the Pixel has speakers only at the bottom.  It's not bad, but you don\u2019t get the same stereo effect as you did on the Nexus 6P.- Like the Nexus 6P, the volume buttons are pretty far down on the side, which makes it hard to use some hands-free car cradles that want to squeeze both sides of the phone without errantly changing your volume for you.- Like both the Nexus 6P and iPhone 6S+, sometimes when you take photos while capturing video you get a slight glitch in the video where you snapped the photo.  C\u2019mon Google, you should be able to fix that!- It doesn't have a micro-SD slot, you're stuck w. the storage the phone comes with.My overall recommendation is to buy this phone, it is the best out there.  Right now you can get it through Verizon, or if you want to purchase the unlocked version you have to buy it from the google store.  However, it\u2019s expensive (similar cost to an iPhone).  If you want a very similar made by Google phone at about half the price (since it\u2019s a year older), I would also strongly recommend the Nexus 6P.  It\u2019s very similar to the Pixel XL, just a little heavier but it will get the latest Android N and the Google Assistant.Happy shopping!\n        ", "price": 316.97, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JCLAA23I3MC6?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "review_rating": 5}, {"review_date": "2017-11-07", "article": "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Quite Black", "review_helpful_votes": 9, "review_title": "\n        ", "review_body": "I bought the pixel XL at Verizon based on all the reviews and hype on the internet.

I would say 90% of the time I can successfully watch the video on the Pixel XL, where it was less than 20% on the Samsungs. Same Verizon network, same locations in Huntington and Plainview NY.* Battery Life blows away the Samsung S6, somewhat better than Note 7* USB C charger cord (inserts both ways) makes it easy to plug in power in dark places (Dont need to know which end is up)* Far better speaker than the Galaxy S6 or Note 7. No matter what angle you place the phone in front of you, the speaker is loud and clear* New OS, I like the built in silence mode that you can choose how long the phone needs to be quite for, and then it automatically will go back to normalCONS of Pixel XL* Samsung's UI is better overall, but I got use to the changes except I miss that the Samsung Notification UI that is far far better. It is less cluttered, easier to understand how many messages, voice mails, etc. are pending for me. This is important to me because I have a mix of whats app, sms, emails, and voice mails. I am struggling with this on my PixelXL* Note 7 introduced a terrific capability to juggle multiple bluetooth sources so that my bluetooth earpiece and bluetooth car stereo/phone played together well / were easy to select between on the Note 7 - gosh I miss this.* Not Waterproof - I suspect I enjoy better speaker performance because this isn't waterproof.* No Wireless charging* Finger print scanner is under phone, which means you have to pick it up to unlock it.* The encryption felt more secure on the Samsung. I get to choose the encryption key, there is an entirely different password that must be entered whenever the device is booted, 10 bad attempts erases the phone.  Verizon claims the Google Pixel is just as good, just different. I don't know, I am having a hard time believing this.* IT bears repeating ... the Notifications aspects of the Pixel XL is very poor.

Letting the device \u2018take a break\u2019 from use or limiting/turning off features (even those running in the background) could remedy the situation. Here are some tips/suggestions:Media apps (music, video games)1) Close or turn off other apps and features that you're not using; they may be running in the background.2) Discontinue using the media temporarily until the temperature normalizes.User-installed apps1) Put the device in safe-mode to disable 3rd party apps and see if the issue improves.2) Try uninstalling recently installed apps to pinpoint the app causing the issue.Display brightness1) Manually setting the brightness to be very bright may contribute to higher device temperature.2) Consider setting to auto brightness to manually reducing the brightness setting.GPS / 3G / WiFi - prolonged data connectivity1) Turn off feature when not in use.2) Stop or limit use and allow device to cool down if it gets warm.Exposure to direct heat1) Remove from heat and keep away from direct heat or excessive sunlight.Poor ventilation1) Expose the device rather than keeping it tucked away in poor ventilated/tight areas (layers, small pockets, bags).Cases1) Don't use a case that covers the front and back of the device.2) Use official case (available on Google Store in some countries).Chargers1) Don't use unofficial chargers which can overcharge and degrade the battery.2) Use official charger (available on Google Store in some countries).Daydream View1) Daydream View requires high performance from the device. The device's temperature should stay within safe limits.2) Remove any protective cases from the device to improve thermal ventilation.3) If your device feels too hot, stop using Daydream View and allow the device to cool down.Android Wear1) Power off the device for 5-10 minutes and turn it on again.2) Try using the watch for another day to see if your issue improves. If your watch is still warm after a day, reply to this email and let us know.Thanks,MadasuThe Google Support Team - Supervisor\n        ", "review_helpful_votes": 16, "review_title": "\n        ", "article": "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Quite Black", "review_rating": 1, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK4EC5MX8OASN?ASIN=B01M01ZZAC", "price": 316.97}, {"review_date": "2019-01-14", "review_body": "I paid over $900 for mine new, with 50% down, I just paid it off and they're already on their 3rd phone. it was AMAZING when i got it. but as soon as the new pixels came out, this on got worse. it got slower, the music app playlists do not work. it will shut itself off with 30% battery.

I'd have to reboot to get it to kick in again.3) The kicker for me was when I used Google maps in the car and only got every other word of the command because the phone was crapping in and out.

Motorola standards this is like looking at a phone designed by someone who only once heard a smart phone described to them (possibly in a foreign language) and are not really clear on the idea of WHY would you need it in the first place.Seriously -  it's a usability NIGHTMARE!1. The regular updates (that you are not aware of) are constantly re-arranging menus.Yesterday my key-board was hiding the paragraph return button behind the Add Emoji option (obvious choice to begin with when you are looking for a 'return' option). Today it's been moved and now hiding as an option for capitalizing a letter. Totally intuitive options in both cases from obviously extensive usability testing trials.2. Fie Sharing -Plugging your Pixel into computer will not let you see files (like normal Androids use to). Now you have to download Android transfer - which .... DOES NOTHING. It Will tell you that you may be not able to connect to anything because your screen is locked - which it isn't. The complete lack of any preferences or options with suggestions on HOW to fix it, adds extra delight to figuring this out.3. Camera -great quality ... nice options to adjust the picture - all in (surprisingly) in one place ... except the Save function. Which is on top pf the screen - elegantly blending with the photo - while all the menus are still highly visible as menus - on the bottom.4. Photo storage -Yes it's broken down into albums but you will need some time to figure out the logic behind how those are structures or how much glue the UI designers had to sniff before coming up with the final logic. Still - if you find what you are looking for it may not be there a few days later when the updates been sent out.5. Sending a text ...A special adventure if you are using it from your addresses. Because while you can find the recipient - it's completely UNclear as to HOW or Where to enter the text. There is actually a number of arrows you need to try before you are allowed to see the text field. Should you need to do this in a hurry - you are out of luck.Adding another person to the text message can only be done Before you start typing it. Sharing a message may be an option but first you will need to figure out HOW to find a person you are sharing it with - the choice of persons given can be random and it is not clear HOW to find the one you need. It may be hidden behind a map icon or just not available at all.Those are just Immediate pleasure I have encountered in the first few weeks of owning this wonder. And I LOVE Androids.
