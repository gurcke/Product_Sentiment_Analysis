[[{"review_title": "Tested against the negative comments, all but one are true! Love this Fitbit!", "review_date": "2018-03-10", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 1275, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "Ok so I promised myself I would test out the Fitbit against the several negative comments and come back and leave a review. All but ONE of the negative comments prove true. Let me start with the negative comments that proved untrue and why:Myth 1: this Fitbit doesn\u2019t record accurate heart data, especially when working out. TRUTH: Yes it does record extremely accurately, including during workouts but you have to read the instructions!! When you workout the instructions say to tighten the strap one hole tighter than you usually wear it. Then you move the Fitbit 1-2 finger widths up from where your wrist meets your hand. After doing this I checked the Fitbit heart rate against my polar heart monitor every 5 minutes during a 45 min kickboxing workout. It was EXACTLY in tune with the polar heart rate monitor, always right on or within 5 BPM. The people who say otherwise are not following instructions or giving it a chance to figure out the best wrist placement.Myth 2: The light against your skin keeps you up at night/you can see the light as you try to sleep. TRUTH: No, you cannot see the blinking light that is against your skin. If you can then your band is way too lose. I wear it every night and never see the light blinking. I don\u2019t even remember I\u2019m wearing it!Myth 3: it scratches easily. TRUTH: I\u2019ve banged mine up pretty bad and to my surprise not a scratch in sight!Okay now for the negative comment that I discovered was true: It does not track steps when you are pushing a grocery cart or stroller. Sadly, this is true. Very frustrating when you have a child and you push them around the zoo all day in a stroller to later discover your steps barely moved. I solve this by letting my husband push the cart/stroller when possible. :) But this is the biggest negative for me about this Fitbit. I just learn to let the number on the screen go on those days when I have no one to push the cart and know that day I had a lot more steps than recorded.Things I love:1. The constant HR monitoring where you can see your heart health over time improve or get worse (in the Fitbit app)2. The sleep monitoring - this has been so eye opening! I can\u2019t wait to check the app in the morning to see how much deep sleep I had the night before. I now know based on my results how I\u2019m probably going to feel that day.3. Getting texts and calls!! It buzzes when you get a text or call and will scroll the message across the screen or show you who is calling. LOVE this feature.4. Stays charged for a long time.5. LOVE that it shows you total calorie burn for the day. Like the calories your body burns just by sleeping or sitting to workouts. This was the biggest reason I got this Fitbit (besides the constant HR monitoring) so I could make sure I was truly burning the calories I thought I was burning to aid in weight loss. That helped me to I know exactly how many calories to cut to lose weight.Things I wish I could change/do but in no way a deal breaker:1. Rearrange which stat I see first when I tap my watch.2. Be able to set it so that I can constantly see my HR when I\u2019m working out. It gets old tapping it several times while I\u2019m working out to find my HR.3. I don\u2019t trust the calorie burn calculator. It seems really low. After a kickboxing workout where my polar monitor says I burned 300 calories, the Fitbit only recorded 130 calories. I\u2019ll keep looking into this and see if I can get something figured out. Thankfully you can add your workout in MyFitnessPal and it will sync up to the Fitbit app, including the calories you burned.4. Would be cool to have an option to add optional stats when you click through on your wrist, such as the weather.I recommend this Fitbit if you are looking to track constant HR, sleep, total calorie burn, and get alerted to texts and calls. I have learned so much about myself and my health.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH4NNXXXZ383A?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Fitbit Customer Service is the WORST!!!", "review_date": "2018-07-12", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 196, "review_rating": 1, "review_body": "My Fitbit Alta HR has been super buggy over the last couple of months (screen goes dead midday despite full battery) and I followed all the troubleshooting advice (which usually consisted of a \"reset\").  It helped for awhile, but this week the HR monitor stopped working altogether.  This is the SECOND Fitbit that I have owned that mysteriously stopped working around a year after purchase (I had the Charge previously that literally started falling apart after a year).  When I contacted Customer Service, their \"canned\" response was that my device was beyond the one year warranty window (by two months, FYI), and the best they could do was offer a 25% discount on my next Fitbit...end of story.  I have now had two failed products from this company...that's a ridiculous track record and abysmal customer service...why on earth would I buy another?!?

I didn't like the product itself, I should have read more comment about it before buying. It's hard to use, and I realized I better by smartwatch.What I don't like: - it's vibrates only ones when phone is ringing and vibration is too subtle, so I will probably miss the call if my phone is in backpack or somewhere in the pocket where I don't feel it. That is why I want to feel vibration on my hand as other smartwatches do. - tapping constantly (and hard enough) on display is nightmare, it's not usable for me or my wife. - icons are too small on display - twisting wrist constantly is hard - display is constantly goes off. it's like 8 bit display, why can't you make it show time all the time, I need to know time when I need it, w/o twisting my arm like crazy. - it doesn't count steps correctly. I really don't know how it counts, but it counts something different. - when I bought this wristband, there was already someone's steps counted, so we couldn't remove them, this is bad!Update: now I got calls from fitbit(or seller I don't really know) related companies ask me to remove that review, as it hurts their business. Guys, I don't agree with you.

Happily switched to the Alta HR when it came out. My wrist is 6.5\u201d and I got a large. I wear it on the second smallest hole (with the Charge HR I\u2019d worn it on the third smallest). I like the large because it can fit around my ankle if I want, and the extra strap fits across most of my under-wrist which I think looks good.STEPS: it does this just as well as the Charge HRHEART RATE: Does this just as well as the Charge HR. I run a few days a week and it gets the same readings.STAIRS: Doesn\u2019t have this function, but I found it flaky in Charge HR and always got more stairs than I\u2019d actually climbed for the day, so I don\u2019t miss it.BATTERY: I had it set with \u201cAll-Day Sync\u201d on and \"Always Connected\" off and the battery has lasted about 8 days. A little after the 6 day mark I started getting low battery warnings (I guess they start happening at 25%). I started getting nervous it would finally give out at the 8 day mark so I put it on the charger. I tried it with \u201cAlways Connected\u201d on next and it lasted almost the same. I got the low battery warning earlier on the 6th day. By the 7th day I decided it was close enough and started charging again, so I'm not sure exactly how long it will take, but at least a week.ALARM: I like this better than Charge HR. The alarm goes and buzzes about four times. If you don\u2019t do anything it stops and snoozes and goes again 9 minutes later. You have to tap it twice (or more, I usually bang on it a few times) to turn it off. Otherwise it just keeps automatically snoozing. I like that if I\u2019ve decided I want to sleep a little longer I don\u2019t have to do anything.SLEEP TRACKING: when set on \u201cnormal\u201d was about the same as Charge HR. I tried it on \u201csensitive\u201d for a few nights and I got big wide bars of \u201crestless\u201d and the tracker only counted the non-restless times as sleep, so even though I was sleeping for 6 hours, it only counted 2 hours as sleeping. I thought that was weird so I\u2019ve had it set to \u201cnormal\u201d since. Maybe this reading would be useful to someone, but I found it confusing. Five days after getting my Alta HR it started tracking \u201csleep stages\u201d. This is cool, I like getting to see what stages I got at night. If you click on the chart it walks you through what the different stages are and what percentage of your sleep they made up.HOURLY ACTIVITY: It warns you ten minutes before the next hour if you haven\u2019t had your 250 steps yet. I like this, I don\u2019t always care to accomplish this throughout the day, but on the days that I do I used to get frustrated if I lost track of time at work and missed an hour since there\u2019s no way to go back and get steps in so you just ruined getting 100%. I\u2019m glad Alta reminds me. Sometimes instead of just walking around I stand up and shadow box - the punching counts as steps and my arms and torso get a workout and I get the elevated heart rate and I can get to 250 quicker.EXERCISE TRACKING: It can tell when I\u2019m running, although like Charge HR it won\u2019t know distances, just steps, heart rate, and calories. It doesn\u2019t have the side button to start an exercise timer, but I never used that in the Charge so I don\u2019t miss it. I have two other apps I use to track my runs, so I don\u2019t care that much about how detailed the Fitbit tracks them. Although I did recently discover the fitbit phone app can track my runs if I start it at the beginning of the run (on the exercise screen click the stopwatch and go to the tracking tab: you can select the activity then click the play button. If it\u2019s a run it uses the phone\u2019s GPS to map the run).CALL/TEXT ALERT: I like getting the little buzz to let me know to check my phone. It displays a little of the text message, but not much. Which is fine, it\u2019s usually enough to give me an idea of whether it\u2019s something important or not.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R179JZ8LXL308O?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "FITBIT for SENIORS and Retirement", "review_date": "2018-04-02", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 97, "review_rating": 4, "review_body": "I purchased for my mom, her doctor said she had slight high blood pressure and needed to lose some weight. I always thought this was a fad but she is really enjoying it. It monitors her activity and I have it set up to send a report to my email. She loves when it shakes and tells her to \"get moving\". Also loves the \"fireworks\" when goals are accomplished. She has gone from 5000 steps to 10000 steps daily. I failed to mention the user is a 68 yr old woman who is NOT computer literate, was previously taking blood pressure medication and now is not. In that sense this device paid for itself. I also think it's kind of a status symbol of some sorts where people of the baby boomer generation think your \"with the times\" when you are wearing technology at their age. It's also a free activity that is beneficial for people in retirement on a fixed income. I'm probably being too harsh for the removal of one star. As a designer I feel like the gold color is on trend and looks expensive. I felt like the band and pink color goes more to the purple side and does not complement the rose gold. Although I'm not a fan of rose gold, I decided that it looks more natural as gold next to my mums jewelry than fake shiny gold. She has chosen a band, that is more lux of which there are many options on amazon. I'm glad it displays the time since she is a flip phone user and still wears a watch. The FITBIT app on her iPad (which she uses for NYTimes but still can't write an email) she said is very easy to understand. Overall, I'd recommend. I'm glad I didn't get her the watch since that has too many features and more for Gen X and down or a tech savvy baby boomer. Also glad I didn't get the one with NO screen and just the lights, that one is better for young people who want to conceal their FITBIT and carry around a smart phone (also nice since they make bands like Tory Burch and other \"designer\" licensed products). The Alta unfortunately does not have this option of tory burch bands but even though the selection is limited, good options are still available. Final thought...can't believe my mom uses a tread mill now, that's the kind of excitement this little device has spurred on.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38H3886EG4W5Z?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "I was very happy when the Fitbit Alta HR was announced", "review_date": "2017-03-26", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 681, "review_rating": 4, "review_body": "I really wanted a small slim tracker, I have very slender wrists.

The watch like clasp is great, the clasp on old fitbits were awful, they did a wonderful update with these ones. The continuous heart rate tracker is exactly what I was hoping it would be.

I didn't like the bulkiness of the Fitbits which did measure heart rate. So I started doing research -- trying to decide what features I did and didn't need. I have been using my phone to track my steps and whatnot to this point. I stopped by the fitbit website to see if they had new offerings and there it was. Exactly what I wanted!I ordered 2 (a small and a large) for my sister and myself from Amazon (2 day shipping!)  I was on the cusp of small/large and I can tell you that both fit, but as the website recommends, size up if you're unsure. I've attached photos with the small and large slightly up my wrist.I love the size, the band, and the display. I appreciate the sleep tracker, the compatibility with MyFitnessPal, the silent alarms, and reminders.While it can receive text messages, it will only display short messages and truncate longer ones. The text displayed is small. If you get 2 or more messages from a person in short succession it will display the number of messages instead of the actual messages. However, I understand that I ordered a fitness tracker, not a smartwatch and so I am pleased it has text reading abilities in the first place.It does not track flights of stairs, which is okay by me. My phone didn't track them either.I have been comparing the steps tracked with my other step tracking apps and it seems relatively accurate.I'm sure that there are more accurate HR trackers out there, but the convenience of having these things together in one place is what sold me.Random side story: My sister stole my large fitbit the other day while I was doing dishes and threw it on her ankle to see if it would track. Not only did it track, but the HR was consistent with her small fitbit on her wrist.Some people have thought the calories are wildly off. I think they don't understand how Fitbit does calories. In many tracking systems, you will be shown how many calories you burned for exercise. So if you've done nothing and see some level of calories burned, you aren't sure why it's saying that. You do burn calories even when inactive. The overall calories for the day aren't that useful for me because I'm used to the system where you only get calories shown for specific exercise sessions but I've found when it tracks a workout session, those calories are pretty accurate.I love the social aspect of it, and I like that you can challenge your friends for a specific day/week/weekend of steps and meeting your goals.I like the app that goes along with the fitbit.Pros:~Design! (I can't express how happy I am with this.)~Tracks HR~Auto tracks exercise~Battery Life (I get around a week and it charges fairly quickly)~Friend challenges and social communityCons:~Not waterproof~Cost (maybe prohibitive, but that is the market of fitness trackers.)~Text messages system (but again, fitness tracker, not smart watch)Honestly, of the negative reviews I've read about this particular item, most of the people who are unhappy didn't do enough research first. You should judge an item by what it advertises it does. So far this has done everything it's said it would for me. I couldn't be happier.I think if you've done your research and this item has the features you have been looking for, you'll be super excited with it, like me.*Edit 6/5*I've had the FitBit Alta HR for a couple months now. I am still just as happy as when I got it.I've lost about 20 lbs since Christmas. It's slow going but the FitBit community has been great.  I posted a picture for my first 5k and 90 some odd strangers cheered me on. Reading the discussion area is always positive and motivating.My only disappointment at this point is the lack of waterproofing because I am swimming more often these days.

So far so good with this tracker! I've had the Fitbit flex, charge, and charge HR as well as a polar FT7 and M400. The polar watches I like but I felt they were too big for daily use. With the charge and charge HR I again thought they were too big for daily use. The Alta HR so far has been great for all day use since it's slimmer than any other fitness tracker. I like the display and have mine set to show the time and my heart rate. I tested the HR monitor out by wearing my polar H7 chest strap and then comparing the results from the polar h7 chest strap to the Alta hr and they were actually pretty similar.

I'm not a morning person, and this wakes me up without making me want to smash it to bits. It was really easy to set up and it's easy to operate both the device and app. Battery life is great - I get about a week out of it. I haven't used it for fitness yet, per se, because I was hoping it would show any sharp changes in my heart rate but unfortunately it shows a \"snapshot\" every five minutes or so. Despite that, there are a lot of really great tools I'm glad I have this for because it's been interesting to KNOW when my heart rate increases and being able to link it to a cause. The sleep tracking insights are my 2nd favorite feature - Invaluable. The best thing I can say is that I've gotten so used to wearing it that I forgot I had it on and accidentally submerged it in the pool once - Still works great. I also splash it washing dishes frequently, so the water resistance feature is strong with this one. I recommend it. Hope to update this review with workout tracking in the future, but I can say for now that it is really satisfying to see the \"fireworks\"  show congratulating you on meeting goals!

I use it for a repeating silent alarm throughout the day (one that is not my cel), tracking heart rate at the gym/hiking, and tracking sleep. I don't really care about steps or calories and those really seem to be what the device is made for (although I haven't checked its accuracy).Out of the gate, it had a problem starting. It was supposed to automatically sync during setup after it was charged, and it wouldn't. I had to search online to troubleshoot it, and there were many other people that had the same problem and few different things to try it, but the info provided with the product was not helpful.The display is supposed to come on automatically when you turn your wrist to look at. Doesn't for me. I have it tagged in the setup info to be on my left wrist, which it is. But it will display when I'm moving my arm in every direction except how one would look at their watch. The alternative it to tap it. I know it's not a touch screen, and one shouldn't expect the same responsiveness, but I have to tap it hard 4-6 times to get the display to show. It's especially annoying when the alarm goes off (which I use very frequently) because I have to keep tapping it several times to turn off the alarm otherwise it will go off again in 9 minutes.The heart rate monitor is pretty consistently 10-20 bpm off when I'm on cardio equipment at the gym that can also read my heart rate. It doesn't matter what brand of cardio equipment, what type of exercise, the Fitbit is always much lower than the reading the equipment gives me. I've tried both tightening the band and sliding it up my arm, but it doesn't seem to help. It seems to be worst when I'm sweating so I don't know if that interferes with it somehow. (Which you can see might be an issue when exercising). I know I can get a reading from the machine I'm using, but I wanted the fitbit to actually track and record my heart rate, which is proving challenging. Plus, I have very little faith in the readings it makes when I can't cross check it with anything else (hiking, running outside, etc).The sleep monitoring is interesting and useful. I have nothing to compare it to, so until I know better the time I spend in each stage is what it tells me it is. Much like how I planned to use my exercise information, I like that I have a record to see how I'm doing over time.And be aware if your skin is fairly sensitive to touch, the device itself gives off a strange pulsing feeling while you wear it. It is odd. I don't love it and it's a good excuse to take it off whenever I'm not trying to track something. Be warned.I would have definitely given it a 2.5 rating if that was an option. I probably would have gone down to a 2-star rating, but I do still use it everyday and plan to continue using it because it's the only option I have for what it does. I just wish it did most things better. I wasn't expecting perfection, but I am disappointed. After you break the seal on the box, I'm not sure it's returnable for any reason other than it being defective (I don't know), but even so I feel you need to spend some time with it to really get a feel for it to decide how it works best for you. Other than the display being a pain in the ass to work I'm not sure any of this technically counts as defective, and even the display is seemingly more a function of poor design than not working the way it is supposed to.

I was mostly drawn to it because of the new sleep stages. It's a huge improvement from the previous sleep tracking. I do also enjoy seeing my heart rate plus, how it shows the area of your heart rate that indicates when you burn more fat.(see photos)The new band- I was hesitant because I really liked the previous Alta band because of how snugly and comfortably it fit me. It looked very sleek and I was nervous about a buckle making it seem too bulky. But I must say, I love it. It is very sleek and looks very professional.I ordered the blue/grey color. And I do see why they call it \"blue/grey\". When I am indoors exposed to mild/comfortable lighting the band looks completely grey with almost no blue in it. When I am outdoors or exposed to very bright lighting the band definitely looks more blue than grey. (See photos) I think it is a very unique color and I'm very pleased with it.I am also very impressed with the time it takes to charge my fitbit. It charges VERY quickly. One charge lasts several days. I must note you should always charge your fitbit using a laptop, if you use the wall to charge your fitbit it may flood too much power into the battery at once and over time it will ruin your fitbit.I have only experienced one issue worth noting. A few days after receiving my fitbit it would stop syncing to my phone (Samsung galaxy S7 edge) but it was a very quick and easy fix. I simply restarted my fitbit via the charging cable (press the button 3 times on the end of the charging cable while your fitbit is charging) it fixed the issue and I haven't experienced any problems since.Overall a 5 star product and I LOVE my Fitbit Alta HR.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FU2SRHIH6LIY?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "First Time Fitbit Buyer", "review_date": "2017-08-02", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 57, "review_rating": 4, "review_body": "I am a first time Fitbit buyer, and after a long debate between the Alta HR and Charge 2, I decided to buy this Alta HR. I ordered the Large size, but I wear it on the second fastener. I used the printable sizing chart on the Fitbit website, and I am very glad I did - otherwise I would have bought the wrong size! I chose the pictured color, which was black on my Amazon app. I love that it doubles as a watch when you turn your wrist to look at it. I downloaded the Fitbit app to find out that the face is customizable, which was a huge deal for me since I love to customize my belongings. The only reason I am rating it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the face is easily damaged. After a month of wearing it, I have a large scuff on the left side of the screen and a small dent farther down. This does not bother me but I realize it may bother others, so I would suggest buying a screen protector if you're worried about damaging the face. One of the coolest features is the sleep monitoring. I have a hard time sleeping, so it was very interesting to see my sleeping patterns. I also enjoy the hourly reminders to move - I definitely have been more active since I got my Fitbit!

I have been looking around for a fitness watch for some time now, I would say at least more than 6 months. If I was going to spend a great amount of money on something I wanted to make sure it was just what I wanted and that I liked it as well as the way it fit. I measured my wrist and i was right at small and large, so I went ahead and went with large, which gives me some 3 more notches to use for it's tightest fit, so the 4th notch fits me perfectly. I suggest if you are just right at the end of a small and beginning of a large measurement, I would recommend going with the large band. I chose the fitbit alta HR because it can still give me my text and call notifications and I was not worried about answering it from my watch or texting back. If my phone is in the other room and I get a call or text, I can see who is calling and read the text on my watch and decided if I want to reply now or later. The functions of the watch are great, easy to use, and scan through right at your wrist where your stats are at. I love that this watch is on the smaller side, it is not bulky at all unlike some watches seem to be. The sleep tracker on it seems to be so accurate and gives you really good details.

I work as a nanny, and therefore spend a lot of time pushing carts and strollers as well as carrying children. I've found that this tracker does not accurately track steps when doing those activities, even when I also use gps tracking through the app on my phone (which also burns through battery and data). It's really frustrating to go on a four or five mile walk and only have 5,000 steps tracked when I actually took about twice as many. I had the Fitbit One before this, but I switched because I didn't have a great place to clip it other than my bra most days and it was very uncomfortable when carrying children. I also wanted to have a tracker that would monitor my heart rate and better track my overall fitness. As I spend a lot of time hiking on the weekends, I was very disappointed to learn that this tracker (unlike the One) does not track elevation gain. Considering the price tag for this item, I feel like those are two things that need to be resolved. I'm definitely a bit disappointed.Update: (photo added) Confirmed that it is about a 40% loss in steps and distance when pushing a stroller/cart. I lowered my rating because of my experience with Fitbit customer service. I contacted them because I think a 40%+ loss of data is an unreasonable margin of error and they basically told me that that's how their tracker works and if I don't like it, then I should look into other fitness trackers...

Seeing my calorie burn as I go through my day is nice, but even better is seeing how that burn adjusts with different types of workouts- HIIT training vs. different types of yoga classes. I've tried a lot of diets and ultimately found that calories in vs. calories out really is the deciding factor in what I weigh. The fitbit doesn't make my healthy choices for me, but I love having a measure of how much I've burned and how much I should be eating. (On some particularly busy days, I've found I need to eat MORE because I'm burning so much running around.) Seeing where my heart rate is at various points in my workout is nice, and allows me to easily and deliberately choose exercise that puts me in my desired heart rate zone(s) on any given day.I didn't expect to be that enthused about the sleep tracking feature, but it may actually be my favorite part. I've mostly recovered from severe adrenal fatigue in the last few years, but I still have a tendency to run on way too little sleep, which sets me back. Since the Alta HR  tracks your sleep and subtracts the times at night when you happen to wake up, this has shown me just how restless I can be and how much less sleep I'm getting than I realized. I've been able to make some adjustments to log more quality sleep time,  and it's making a difference in my health.I'm also a fan of the morning alarm feature, as well as the little buzz you can set to remind yourself to go to bed.I did change the band out for a leather one, because the rubbery one it comes with isn't attractive, in my opinion.

After a low battery warning, I plugged it in to the finicky charging port.  I was a little concerned when it failed to come back on, but figured it was totally dead.  A few hours later- NADA.  Although I was confident it was seated correctly, I checked the port again and gave it a couple more hours.  Still, it was unresponsive.

(I also have a Polar H7 chest strap but was hoping to move towards a wrist-based device in the gym.  The strap works great, but sometimes it's a hassle.)On the box, the Alta HR appeared to do everything that I wanted.  After wearing it for four days, I decided to return it.  There are many good things about this device but unfortunately, it did not work for me when I most wanted it - (in the gym)PROS:--Aesthetics: The rose gold is worth the extra cost if you prefer gold to silver.  I ordered several accessory bands to dress it up.Indeed, this device can be dressed up for a night out or dressed for sweat with the included athletic-type band, (or another, if pink isn't your style).Can't speak to the band color issues -- I didn't keep mine long enough, but I preferred the accessory bands to the pink one, so I only used the stock band in the gym, (because I felt the rubber-texture would hold it's position better/be more comfortable while working out... it did do a great job keeping the Alta in place on my small wrist during my workout.)Don't choose the pink special edition for the band.  Choose it for the rose gold -- it's really pretty, (well, if you like rose gold... otherwise stick with silver!)--Ability to change bands:  The design on this device to swap out bands is brilliant!  The process is simple, elegant and straightforward -- takes all of five seconds to transform the appearance.  That clip design creates a seamless and secure attachment, making any band look like it belongs, as long as you've chosen colors that you like with your Alta model -- I felt confident that my device was not going to slip loose.(I can only speak for snug bands though -- I did not try any \"bangle\" type bands.)--Fitbit's platform:  I have enjoyed a Fitbit One for several years and was looking forward to the enhanced capabilities of the Alta HR.  It gives more detailed sleep data, enhanced step tracking, as well as continuous heart monitoring, allowing the device to detect (and thus record) certain types of exercise without having to log them manually.  Lots of great features, (that DO work very well, btw), with this device.  I didn't have any problems with sleep or step recording.CONS:--Display during workout:  This device does not have a continuous \"on\" display option.  The Alta HR must be physically tapped to have the display turn on, and then quickly tapped again to see subsequent items.I wasn't bothered by this during casual wear but found it to be cumbersome in a gym setting -- because it did not allow me to quickly glance at my heart rate when my arms were engaged.--Display in outdoor settings:  very difficult to see in sunlight.  I needed to go in the shade (or tap/cup to shade really fast) to catch the readings.  Very easy to read indoors.--Heart rate monitoring:  (This one was the deal breaker for me...)I checked the accuracy of the heart rate, (resting, normal activities &amp; in the gym), against my\u00a0Polar H7 Bluetooth Heart Rate Sensor &amp; Fitness Tracker (Black, X-Small/Small).For resting &amp; day-to-day activities, the Alta was remarkably in sync with the H7.  I expected the margin to be much greater, but my heart rate consistently tracked within 5 beats between the two devices.Unfortunately, it failed at the gym, which is the main reason that I decided to purchase the Alta HR.  To me, this is a defect in the design.I like to use cardio machines that involve my arms, (specifically Jacob's Ladder).  On that machine, and the elliptical (with fully engaged arms), the Alta HR failed to detect my HR at all!During a vigorous 20 minute \"climb,\" my Polar app, (linked to the H7 chest strap), allowed me to see that I was maintaining my HR in my target workout zones.  The Alta requires tapping the device to see the stats, so I couldn't check it during my workout (without interrupting the workout).  I worked on, assuming that all was being recorded.I did not expect perfect counting of steps, (many machines are not compatible with wrist-based step counters), but I did expect my activity to be recorded based on my elevated HR.After I synced the device with my Fitbit app, there was NO EVIDENCE of my having worked out!  I know that I maintained an elevated heart rate for a full 30 minutes before cooling down and my Alta did not record any part of that time as \"active\" !!  That tells me that this device is not compatible with normal gym use.For my gym workout time, I used the pink band that came with the Alta HR, so I know the recording issue was not related to a third party band.  It was properly positioned two finger widths above my wristbone, snug against my skin.  It registered my heart rate &amp; steps UNTIL I started working out and AFTERWARDS, but not DURING.(And for the record, all three third-party bands that I tested with my H7 (during rest and casual activity) did register perfectly with the Alta.  Fitbit states that third-party bands may yield inaccurate readings.)  I tried the Henoda leather/tan, Swees metal/rose gold and Oitom metal/coffee brown replacement bands -- all three were wonderful.--Comfort:  This is a mixed bag for me.  The Alta HR is \"comfortable enough.\"  I think all fitness watches are clunky.  I expected this to be no different.  Its narrow profile is really nice but it does not lay as flush as a normal watch and definitely has a presence on the wrist.At times, it felt stiff/uncomfortable because the sensor is longer than the flat top of my wrist.  The band is designed to keep it in place despite that bit of extra length and it does look nice, but it felt big on me.  Careful adjustment of the strap keeps it from sliding up and down on the wrist.It comes as close to jewelry as any heart monitoring device on the market today can, so I would have kept it if it had properly recorded my gym activities.CONCLUSION:If your gym activities do not involve machines that actively engage your arms, then perhaps this might work well for you.It works great for walking, jumping around, (fitness classes that don't involve wrist/forearm activity), and can be dressed up with a simple band change, allowing all-day fitness prompts &amp; monitoring in a professional-looking package.  Fitbit has a nice platform with customizable (and thus attainable) goals.Other members in my family own the Charge HR and Surge -- I haven't tried them, but no one has complained about lacking HR monitoring during activities -- not sure why my Alta HR was unable to do so... (Perhaps mine was defective, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of an exchange.)I'm going to stick with my Fitbit One for steps &amp; H7/Polar app for the gym.  This experience has reminded me that I wanted a nice new gadget, but didn't really need one.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9BFRPJ6VT9E?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Heart Rate drops completely during workout session", "review_date": "2017-05-10", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 70, "review_rating": 1, "review_body": "Not a fan of the autotracking an activity session with this new fitbit.

Maybe if the fitbit phone app has a function to set that when you're in and out of activity mode from there, and let that information sync with the device, maybe that might help offset the autotracking prematurely ending.I guess this is the trade off with this model being more slim-line: they can only put so much into the hardware.PS.

I have a fairly sedentary job and get my exercise more from walking-gardening-and similar type activities. Therefore, I was not very concerned with how this device tracks during any specific type of workout, and I'm not tracking calories burned. I am interested in heart rate, sleep, steps per day, and the various reminder functions, so this review focuses more on those.The main reason I got a Fitbit:  I wanted to keep track of my steps, and I very much needed a way to get silent alarms at work, as I don't carry my phone everywhere. Once I started wearing the Fitbit, I felt a lot better about how many steps I take in a day:  I have a good pedometer app on my phone, but that's not effective when you're moving around a lot without the phone in hand. For whatever reason, it doesn't track my flights of steps very well, but it does really well when I'm working in the yard (moving around erratically). I can't tell exactly what triggers it to count an activity as exercise:  some walks I take register as active minutes, whereas other activities do not. It would be nice if it counted things that get your heart rate up-- housework, heavy chores-- as active minutes.It tracks heart rate well, a lot better than I expected. I've measured it against my pulse-ox, and it's most accurate between about 60-100. I do have tachycardia, and the Fitbit does not track high HR well (and frequently just reads \"--\"). This isn't intended to be a medical device, but I hope that future models improve in this area.For me, the alarms are great for reminders during the day to get up and move (default settings) or to take meds (alarms I set myself). Be aware that there's just one vibration level, and it's not super-strong. The advertising mentions that you can use it as a morning alarm, but this wouldn't even make me twitch in my sleep (I am a sound sleeper). I also miss some of the hourly get-up-and-move alarms. While I'm awake, though, the ones I set for medication are impossible to ignore. If you need to stay on a strict schedule with anything and don't always have your phone with you, this is a good option. It's also silent, so it's not going to disrupt a meeting or attract attention.I find the sleep tracking interesting. I don't know how accurate it is, because I don't really have any way to know that. You can view data (for the day or for a duration of time) via the app or the web interface. I use both, because neither one gives me all the information I want. I'm not crazy about the UX for the website, but the app is plenty user-friendly. There's no learning curve at all:  it's intuitive.I got the small blue-gray band, as I didn't want it to be too obvious or to scream fitness tracker. That color is a good compromise between stark black and a bright color (if this is your style). I also have a silver tone Oitom band, which is what I wear to the office or to go out. For cleaning, gardening, walking, etc., I switch back to the original band. Swapping out bands is a breeze, so definitely invest in a spare band(s) if you're interested in changing up the look.I have a small wrist, and the fitness tracker portion sort of looks like it's perched on top of the wrist. I would not want anything any larger! It's recommended to wear the band 2 finger-widths above your wrist bone during exercise, and that's where mine sits all the time. It hasn't gotten in the way of anything so far, but I haven't worn in through fall/winter (coats, gloves, sleeves . . .).Tilting your wrist to see the time is about 50/50 for me. I've found that rotating my wrist slowly to see the time is more effective than quickly flicking the face over. Your mileage may vary. I do just give up and tap it sometimes (\"tap\" is the word the instructions use-- it's got to be a pretty solid thump, but call it what you will).Overall:  HR monitoring could be improved on the higher end but works well for the most part. It tracks standard activities well but does not track some everyday activities as \"active minutes.\" I wish you could adjust the strength of the vibrating reminders. I'm interested in the data it provides, and, between the app and the website, Fitbit explains how to interpret the data (which is helpful:  e.g., it gives you benchmarks for time spent in deep sleep). It's not perfect with sprinkles on top, but it rates a solid 4 stars for getting the job done and giving me an overall accurate picture of m day (and night).FIVE-MONTH UPDATE:PROS:  I haven't scarred up the face yet, in spite of crashing into things on a regular basis.  I'm surprised it's withstood the amount of hardship I inflict on it.  I'm very pleased with how long it holds a charge.  The app continues to sync well with the phone, though I don't have it running constantly in the background (to preserve phone battery life).  I haven't drenched it, but I have splashed it a fair amount, and that hasn't hurt it.CONS:  HR tracking can be *way* off when my HR goes either very high or very low.  After I reach about 120 bpm, the accuracy goes out the window (I have tested that against a pulse/ox).  As others have mentioned, the step count is not 100% accurate, depending on your daily activities.  I know I reached my step goal one day while standing still and brushing my teeth-- it was the arm motion.  Typing will also skew your total steps higher.  Needless to say, if your days are pretty similar in structure, you can kind of guess how many steps to subtract from the total shown, but it's just something to be aware of.  This is still a solid 4 stars.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Z1NGEWMNPZF3?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Horrible Product", "review_date": "2017-10-28", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 10, "review_rating": 1, "review_body": "I have owned this Fitbit Alta HR for one week and the HR monitor has stopped working and the pink band has black wear showing on it.

Because the hardware is longer, the band bends at an awkward place on my wrist and doesn't ever rest quite comfortably on my arm. It make it difficult to find the right band tightness; it's either too tight and won't read my HR, or it's too big and falls too far down my forearm to be a \"bracelet' anymore.I do like the interchangeable band. That feature is very easy; I've already replaced my band with a black band for much cheaper than the difference between Fitbit's fuschia HR &amp; black HR.I thought I could manage without the button to track workouts, but I was wrong. If you are very active and use that regularly, I would not recommend this version. It's not very accurate at automatic tracking, so I have to be mindful of when my workouts begin and end so I can edit the auto track results. When I'm doing something with a constantly raised HR like elliptical or running, it gets most of the workout. However if you do any sort of combo workout like cardio pilates, bodyweight exercises, etc, in which your HR is varied, you'll find it does not usually pick those up because of the limited categories of tracking in the fitbit app.I should also note that it does not track stairs, but if you were tracking stairs in the app w/ a previous fitbit, the app will still display stairs when you link the Alta. It would be nice if they could find a way to remove stairs from the app when you link this. I was very confused for the first few days why I had zero stairs every day.Bottom line: if you are just in it for step tracking, it's a fine band. It does the trick.

I started off narrowing it down to 2 devices the Garmin Vivosmart HR+, and the FitBit Alta HR, on paper both had pros and cons, came down to the fact that I found a great deal on the Garmin so ordered that first. Spent a month with it and then got the Alta HR so I could make a fair comparison. Here is what I found.Pros:Love the form factor, very comfortable to wear, much more so than the GarminI like the fact that you can swap out the bands, or replace them. Can\u2019t\u2019 do that with the GarminI like the LED interface better than the LCD on the Garmin. Much easier to see, especially in low light.Cons:The tapping! Ugh\u2026.had this for about a week now and I still can\u2019t get the tapping down. 90% of the time, I need to redo the double tap sequence at least 3 times to wake it up. Horrible.The wake up feature with the wrist motion, is almost as bad as the tapping, probably works about 50% of the time.No specific activity tracking. I know other FitBit models have this, and this is supposed to have a smart feature that \u201cfigures out\u201d when you are working out. But in my experience, that doesn\u2019t work very well.The syncing with the app is horrible (I use Android).  Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn\u2019t. No indication why. On the Garmin this just works.Splash resistant, not waterproof.

I am very glad she loved it!This Christmas I received a FitBit Alta HR as a gift and was super excited to use it. I love the sleekness of the band and face. It is simple and goes with everything, therefore I chose the Black band with silver sides. I wanted a simple tracker to track my calories/exercise and the fit bit does exactly that. For this Fitbit, you have to tap on the face to switch between screens (time, HR, steps, cals) and one thing I will say is that it is unresponsive to the tap at times. Not a huge deal, but just something to keep in mind. You really do have to tap on it hard sometimes to get the screen to advance. The set up was incredibly easy and linked to an apple phone. No problems with set up, super easy and straightforward.The battery is great, I am on day 5 and at about 30% left with one charge so I think I will most likely get 7 days out of every charge which is amazing. The band isn't water proof, but it is \"water resistant\" which is nice in case water splashes when you're washing your hands/dishes/etc. I read negative reviews about how the step counting was off and the band is too sensitive, as in it was counting steps that weren't being taken. So far, I haven't noticed this on my Fitbit and it has been working excellently.

It's as accurate as any of the others (read: not very), looks nice and fits well, and gives you quick access to various statistics like steps taken and your heart rate.The big problem here is that Fitbit seemingly does not care about the device synching with many Android phones. The last of the officially supported phones in Moto's G and X lines came out in 2014. Motorola -- not exactly a fly-by-night manufacturer --  has sold tens of millions of these things, and Fitbit does not support any of the models made in the past five years. Some people can get it to work, but if not, you're just out of luck. None of the provided work-arounds resolved the issue for me, and Fitbit support says their engineers are working on adding new phones all the time. I have to wonder what phones they're adding if not ones released more than a year ago by a major manufacturer.So with no synching between my device and phone (an updated Moto G5 Plus), I can't make use of the app while exercising, and I don't receive notifications of calls or texts on my wrist like I should. So I have a $150 digital watch and pedometer that will synch with my laptop when I get home. (Hey, at least I caught it on a Cyber Monday sale for a little more than half price...) I of course can only blame myself for not researching phone compatibility first, but my recently-dead Fitbit Flex had no trouble working with my current phone, so I figured this would too. Oh well.As I've already worn it for a few weeks now and it works as advertised, so I can't in good conscience return it Amazon.

I became interested when it knew my resting heart rate and non-resting heart rate as well as sleep quality.  Sleep is everything.The FitBit HR Alta told me how I slept last night, was very accurate as to what stages of sleep I was in.  Example a train came by and woke me up at 5:00 am it recorded I woke up out of REM.  This was True.  I had a great dream at 8 AM when alarm went off--so I slept in and it recorded I was back to REM in moments and for the next hour.  [It was a great dream.]  I have been in many sleep studies because I am a kicker, (meaning I wake myself up kicking) and this was also true midnight and 2 AM.  They call it restless leg syndrome.  My official sleep study with probes all over my head proved this is why I used to feel drained every morning and not really getting any REM.  Because I was not getting any REM with all the kicking as I approached a deep sleep. So I deem it VERY accurate and now I can see what supplements help me not kick so much - since I can use the FitBit Alta HR as a guide to sleep quality.Most people buy fitbit to monitor DAY activity.  This is the LAST reason I bought it for.  All my staff has one, even my bookkeeper so they tend to compete in their own little contests.  Now I can join them.

I saw the Alta HR and the thin line design and thought, oh good, not so huge on my wrist. I measured my wrist, like it said to do, had someone even help me do this. I showed I have a size 8 in wrist. I have large bones, lol. After it arrived. I read the instructions three times. Put the fitbit on the charger while I was reading them. Nowhere in the instructions did it say to let the thing charge before using, but you do want to do this. Once it was charged I put it on for the first time. I put it where I thought it should be and looked and it was the last hole. So, instead of the x-large band, I should have gotten the large band. No problem, will just buy new bands. It says to tap it to show the time, I tap, nothing, so I tap harder, still nothing. I give it a good tap, ah, it is awake. My biggest thing I do not like about this is that I do have to tap it quite hard to get it to activate. Plus wearing it with the face up on my wrist I get one pulse measurement, wearing it with the face underneath my wrist, my pulse measurement went up 3. So which is correct? The one on top of the wrist or the one closer to the blood vessels that pump the blood?

It's accurate, the charge lasts for a whole week, and it can connect to other fitbit friends so you can compete for step counts with your siblings, coworkers, etc. Great for setting a silent alarm because it will just vibrate on your wrist. Integrates with text messages so your wrist buzzes when your phone buzzes (that could be a pro and a con, depending how you look at it).Cons: Does NOT integrate with many of the health apps I already use!!! This is a big con for me as I assumed fitbit would automatically sync up with my sleep app and my food apps etc. It does track sleep if you manually enter in the start and stop time, but the sleep data is pretty basic and it's inconvenient to have to manually set each night and morning. The touch screen doesn't always work. Gets dirty fast.Overall: I should've done more research before purchasing. If all you want is to track steps and heart rate, this is for you.

There should be a full owner's manual that comes with these, like the length of a car manual. It typically only tracks your steps when your whole body is moving the way it would if you were walking. So for example, if you're pushing a shopping cart, it may not track your steps, since your wrist remains stationary. It fits well and doesn't slide around too much, and the app/website are both user friendly. The interchangeable bands that are sold for the Alta HR are all pretty great and fit really well, but the plastic bands including the ones that come stock with the device do get dirty very easily.If you've had another Fitibit or tracker in the past, I'd recommend unpairing that from your Bluetooth, even if you no longer have the app installed. It can definitely cause some issues with your ability to sync the Fitbit. I ended up never using the app anyway because of all the syncing issues I had with this one. Finally, the most important thing... buy a screen protector and just be careful! The actual device where the screen is located sits up really high from your wrist, so it's very easy to naturally bump/scratch this tracker on literally everything. I had a few scuffs that came out relatively easily with some rubbing alcohol and a microfiber rag, but I've seen a lot of issues with other people having scratches on theirs that will not come out. The screen protector is important... put it on before you even use this thing for sure. And don't wear it while you do anything that you feel may potentially cause you to hit it against something.With all this being said, Fitbit has created a great program and a good device.

Beyond all the other things it can monitor, the sleeping data has been the most helpful.  I can only assume it is accurate/reasonably accurate, but if it is then it strongly suggests I'm sleeping very much like most men in my age bracket.

Longevity probably isn't in it's game plan, and this makes sense to a certain degree.

It's annoying to switch back and forth on the app,  so it would be much better if it would display my heart rate on the app.Another downside is that you HAVE to turn your wrist for it to display anything, or tap it quite hard so that it shakes it and THINKS you have turned your wrist. It also doesn't always recognize that I have turned my wrist. It makes me feel like I didn't say \"pretty please?\" first.I don't like that it's not waterproof. I wish I could wear it in the shower like I used to be able to do with my other fitness band,Lastly, I used to have a Garmin VivoSmart HR, which I really liked. It was falling apart, and I was looking for an \"upgrade\" to a sleeker, more customizable fitness band. It was MUCH better at calculating my average resting heart rate, which is naturally low. I know it was more accurate because doctors have confirmed my naturally low resting heart rate. I believe this fitbit is still good at grasping increased heart rate, just not low heart rate.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2APCF5J46REG4?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Great purchase at discount prices.

I did lots of research and was disheartened that every gadget has such a large share of negative reviews.

I've had mine a month, and it lasts 7 days before it needs a full charge.-It lets you know when calls come through and who is dialing you.-It shows you the calories burned every day (and what your targets should be based on goals you set up.)-It's very user intuitive and easy to set up.-You can set multiple goals, like water consumption, sleeping, exercise.-It tracks your pulse and when your heart rate is up for periods of exercise.-It's sturdy.-I was going to buy a treadmill at home, but now don't feel the need.  I'll walk laps in the living room while watching TV because I know I can track the steps, miles, and calories I'm burning.-It's increased my water consumption since that's one of my goals.-It's increased my daily activity. It was eye-opening to me to see that on a normal \"base\" day the steps I put in. Post-baby, I hadn't taken off weight very quickly and didn't know why. I was stuck at a plateau. I've lost 4 pounds since wearing this.  Only thing I'm consciously doing differently is making sure to hit my daily step target.Con's-I take mine off when I shampoo my hair (not daily) or go to the pool. I want to prolong its life.

Wish I had saved my money.  The HR stands for Heart Rate, so I assumed that the heart rate counts would be accurate.  Wrong.  It's usually not even in the ballpark.  I was using a pulse oximeter to check the accuracy and the Fitbit was often as much as 15 beats per minute off.  The step tracker is also inaccurate (and yes, I did my stride measurement and entered it into the app).  The exercise feature inaccurately registers calories burned for various activities - for example, it shows 118 burned in 30 minutes of high intensity aerobics for someone my weight, whereas the accurate count is 243 or higher..Foods logged cannot be removed from the master list ever.  I don't understand this at all.  If you log something that you'll probably only eat once or rarely (for example, Cajun rice), it will be on the master list forever and the list will become so cluttered that it'll give you a headache trying to pick something from it to log that you eat regularly.  I totally DO NOT understand why they would block you from removing items from your food list.

I am left scratching my head and wondering how Fitbit has become so popular when their product is so completely underwhelming.  While the product does have the basics, the functionality is intentionally crippled by Fitbit in what I can only guess is a misguided attempt to get to to upgrade?For example, Fitbit relies on the device to automatically determine that you have been exercising to start tracking an activity, and it does not accurately sense weightlifting, yoga, and probably most any activity that does not involve a constantly elevated heart rate.  No issues so far, as I wouldn't expect the device to be able to determine all types of activities and so you would need to manually trigger some activity start and stop times..  However, you can only manually start and stop tracking an activity if it involves walking, running or hiking, and even then you have to do it from your phone and not the device itself.  Huh?  Yes, I said that right - if you want to manually start and stop tracking an activity on your Fitbit, you have to start and stop it ON YOUR PHONE!  And then it only works if it involves walking or running.  Since Fitbit requires you to use the app on your phone to manually track an activity, then why are they limiting the activities to walking, running or hiking and not allowing any other activity that you want to track?  No idea, and it is just plain dumb.  They have a workaround - they let you log previous activities that will essentially tag them to data that was previously recorded on the device covering the same time period.  But if Fitbit can allow you to go back in time and log an activity that occurred in the past, then why the heck don't they just let you say when to start and stop an activity so that it tracks it as you do it?  Again, no idea and so tracking any activity other than running or walking is a major pain in the butt.This device will notify you when you get a call or text, but you had better look quickly.  The messages scroll on the screen one time and only one time and you cannot get them to replay.  Why not?  No idea.I just don't understand why the functionality on this device is so poorly put together.  The device has touch and so starting and stopping an activity from the device should be easy to implement.  So should being able to replay calls or texts.  People who are considering this device - realize that other devices DO allow you to do these things from the device itself and don't get this one.  As it stands, the Alta HR is just a glorified step counter with built in heart rate and is a pretty poor fitness tracker.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25LIGTUKX66PE?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Very Disappointing Product", "review_date": "2018-11-15", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_rating": 1, "review_body": "I used mine for 14 months (replaced the original band twice).

After reading reviews for various trackers, I decided that the Alta HR would be best for my needs. Unfortunately, after using it for a week and a half, I had to return it. The first problem was that the Alta HR did not accurately count my steps. It would register far more steps than I actually took. For example, my bed is approximately 8 feet from my bathroom. When I would get up in the morning the Alta HR would record 50+ steps for the 15 or so actual steps I took to and from the bathroom. I believe it was interpreting my handwashing as steps. I called Fitbit customer service and the very nice rep told me to restart the Alta HR and see if that solved the issue. I did so, and then checked my actual steps against what the Alta HR registered. I did this test at my Y's indoor track, carefully counting 100 actual steps. I repeated the experiment about 8 times. Only once did the Alta HR come close to my actual steps. Each time it was over or under about 15 - 30 steps. The Alta HR also would not respond smoothy to my taps or wrist movement. The clock face on the Alta HR is supposed to light up when you turn your wrist. This rarely happened. I experimented with gentle and sharp turns, and it rarely turned on. I would try tapping it to turn on the clock face, and again, the Alta HR would only intermittently flash the clock face. The lack of response to tapping was also annoying when trying to access the other stats such as heart rate, active minutes, etc. Finally, the Alta HR was not comfortable to wear. I tried wearing it with the original band, and that was either too tight or loose. I immediately bought an infinitely-adjustable metal mesh band with magnetic closure to see if that would fit better. It allowed me to wear the Alta HR at its recommended looseness for daily use, and tighten it up for more accurate measurements during workouts.  Even with this band, the Alta HR was uncomfortable. It would knock against my wrist bone throughout the day, and wake me up at night. I believe a tracker that lays flat against your wrist, instead of sticking so far up, would be more comfortable. The one positive thing about the Alta HR was the sleep tracking. It was interesting to see my sleep patterns for the time I was wearing it. However, due to the step count being so wrong, I wonder how accurate the sleep  data was.

Just yesterday it claimed I was pushing 4,000 calories burned, but outside of some walking and standing around I didn't do much in terms of physical activity.  Didn't even manage to hit the gym like I normally do.  I believe this is the result of a gross miscalculation of calories burned by walking, as it's tracking walking at a steady, non rushed pace as 10+ calories burned per minute while most other sources online put someone with my physical characteristics at 6-7 call/min at the same pace.HR monitor will cut out time to time with the tracker staying at the same point and tightness on my wrist, and no exaggerated arm movements to shift it around.Just the other day I realized it's not counting steps correctly, as in I'd spend 5-10 minutes walking around the house trying to get my step count up only to realize at the end not a single step was logged.  After repeating with exaggerated arm movements, still no luck.  By Fitbits own admission (buried in documentation) the way steps are counted, some steps simply don't register on soft ground.  They used carpet as an example but I found wet grass/dirt and sand also tracks only intermittently.

I was very happy with my original alta but upgraded to the HR when it came out. While the alta HR is a really great item, it definitely isn't perfect and I found the lack of clear information about it's actually features to be lacking. Here are some of the pros/cons that I think people might want to know before buying:PROS-Sleep tracker is neat but I pretty much stopped checking it after a while. It tends to show you as getting less sleep than you actually do and that can lead to anxiety for some people. Now I charge it at night.-Wrist band now has a buckle which is way more secure than other trackers. No more worrying about it popping off your wrist!-The HR monitor is pretty great for a wrist device. I use a chest HR monitor during my workouts and the 2 readings are usually pretty similar. The alta needs to be tight on your wrist though!-For some reason they removed the date display from the watch. I really like wearing a wristwatch and the original alta also displayed the date, which was helpful.-You can choose what info you want to display on the watch itself as well as the app.-I really like the app. I usually keep it open while I'm on the elliptical so I can watch my heart rate in real time.CONS-There is no feature that allows you to start a workout. If you do an activity continuously for 10-15 mins it will give you a summary afterward of calories burned, and heat rate. You cannot use it to track steps/distance for a specific activity however...it only gives a daily total. (It's pretty smart though, knows when I've been biking).-After days of continuous wear (I took it off to shower and to charge/clean it). I developed an itchy rash under the charging area. I take it off at night now and that seems to help-The battery doesn't last a super long time. I was charging it everyday while I was in the shower, but it always seemed to be running low. Again, I charge it at night now.-If the alta is not tight against your skin, you may get wildly inaccurate readings.-If you want an accurate resting HR reading, you MUST sleep with the watch tightly clasped.-Perhaps to be expected but the bands get quite dirty and I had a hard time cleaning them. I mostly stick with the black one since it hides dirt the best.-As with the original alta, it does not count flights of stairs climbed; only steps, distance and heart rate.-Reading the watch can be annoying. It is supposed to display the time when you lift your arm to your face, but it doesn't always do that. Then I find myself tapping it like a madman in frustration. Once it's on, its easy to cycle through features however.Overall, I'm happy with it. There are a few flaws with the actual design of the watch, but you cannot get a more accurate, continual HR watch for a better price.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38WARH253P33N?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "My favorite Fitbit so far", "review_date": "2018-07-25", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "I wasn't sure if I would like this as much as my Charge HR, but I like this better. The thinner profile works for my wrist and I like that the HR sensor is flush with the back of the tracker. I was concerned that this doesn't track stairs climbed or allow you to press a button to start a work out, but I realized I rarely used that feature,typically allowing the auto tracking to do the work. So this works for me just as well on the Alta. As others have mentioned, the light band on the rose gold can stain quickly. I bought some other bands through Amazon that are a darker color and use those daily. I use the lighter one occasionally. I was hesitant to buy the rose gold but so far no scratching or wear is showing with daily and nightly wear. It looks great with the pink band and additional navy, gray and white bands I purchased. Bands are very, very easy to switch out, taking a few seconds at most. One negative is the lack of a button. Sometimes it can be hard to stop an alarm, requiring a lot of screen tapping but after reading a tip elsewhere to tap where it says Fitbit on the screen, that works!

It also tracks heart rate and miles walked. However, I have tendonitis in my feet so I use the exercise bike at the gym more than anything; unfortunately, the Fitbit Alta HR doesn't recognize that. But it does recognize, as \"cardio,\" when I mow my lawn so I guess that's a bit of a trade off.The smart phone app is pretty good and the device communicates well with it. One thing I've had trouble with -- and I see others have similar complaints about this particular model, is that it doesn't monitor my sleep correctly. I'm very impressed by the detailed charts and graphs it sends to my phone, but it doesn't start monitoring my sleep until around 3 am or even later. I've set up both my bedtime and wake up times but the Fitbit doesn't start registering anything about my sleep for several hours. Clearly, this is a glitch within the device since so many people are reporting similar problems on Fitbit's website.So, I like it as far as keeping up with my steps (I've set it to the standard 10,000 a day) but the sleep monitoring is a bit disappointing. I was as eager to learn more about that as I was keeping up with my walking schedule since I often have sleep problems. It only records three or four hours of sleep a night for me since it skips the first three or four hours.Another minor thing I didn't care for is the silicone strap that comes on the device. I bought a leather replacement [see pictures] which is SO much better! There are a multitude of styles, colors, and materials available in replacement bands online so there's something for everyone at reasonable price too.It needs to be charged about every four and a half days or so which is a bit more often than Fitbit's estimation of about seven days. Charging is easy via USB [only] either through a laptop or USB charging cube. Charging is done strictly via the Fitbit cable (included). While it's easy to clip the charger onto the device, care must be taken to ensure the contacts on the charger align properly with the contacts on the device. When it's clamped on correctly, the device will vibrate for a second or so. Charging isn't all that fast, and I haven't actually timed it. I'd estimate a couple of hours for full charge but that's just a guess.What I recommend for anyone interested in a Fitbit is that you thoroughly compare all the Fitbit models and read all you can about each one, especially reviews from people who own them.

Fitbit shows much less.  The other is the amount of sleep which sometimes is rarely correct and usually shows less than I know I slept.  For those two reasons, I gave Fitbit three stars.

Im hoping that this is just the thing to get me moving a little more because its encouraging to see how much you actually move around in a typical day and the calories you burn. Also shows me my heart rate, resting or in activities.I was concerned that i may not be getting quality sleep (a health thing again) and really happy it automatically records my sleeping modes and shows whether or not you are sleeping well or tossing and turning.Im very happy with my purchase and although some reviews said they were a few problems, everything works appropriately for me.  The charger snaps right on easy to see its working correctly.

It only registers walking activity if you move outside the GPS circle of accuracy or you manually tell it you are walking. In other words, GPS will only locate you within 10-30 feet. If all your walking activity is within that circle, it won't register your walking as activity but it will register the steps.

At first I found the hourly reminders to move to be annoying and refused to play along, but it's fun to earn a star for the day, so I make the effort to get in my 250 steps nine hours a day.I chose the Alta HR because it was narrow and unobtrusive.

It\u2019s modular, so the bands on either side of the plastic module in the middle can be easily swapped out. It has the same display as the Alta. It\u2019s not touch sensitive, but requires a tap on either the face or side of the module if you want to cycle through your data. This can get annoying.There is one noteworthy design change: the strap. Last year\u2019s Fitbit Alta had a snap-in clasp (one I didn\u2019t like very much), but this year\u2019s has a more traditional railroad-style strap.Some people have asked me whether the Fitbit Alta HR is now a replacement for the Charge 2. My answer is: not really. They\u2019re the same price and both have heart rate sensors. But you can stop and start exercises with the Charge 2, and you can\u2019t do that at all with Fitbit Alta HR. The Fitbit Alta HR will automatically recognize if you go for a run, but it\u2019s not something you can control, and it doesn\u2019t display a timer during your activities.So what can this Fitbit do? It does what a Fitbit does. It tracks your steps, your distance traveled (without GPS), your calories burned, and your sleep. It shows you notifications and incoming calls from your smartphone. What\u2019s new about the Alta HR is that it has optical heart rate sensors built into the underside, so it records your heart rate throughout the day, and Fitbit will now show you more advanced sleep data in its app. This latter feature isn\u2019t limited to just the Alta HR; it will work with any newer Fitbit that has heart rate sensors. I look at the Fitbit Alta HR\u2019s heart rate data as something that is nice to have, data that I wouldn\u2019t trust entirely but could still help to inform other activity decisions.The same goes for distance tracking: since the Alta HR doesn\u2019t have GPS, or even connected GPS through the phone, my expectations were low. After a five-plus-mile hike last Friday, the Fitbit app told me I had taken more than 19,000 steps total that day and had been active for 158 minutes, but I also noticed within the app that the activity was automatically recorded as just 4.97 miles.This is also the same with sleep tracking: unless you venture into a lab and have sleep sensors taped to your body and have that sort of data to compare it to, it\u2019s hard to gauge the accuracy and efficiency of consumer trackers like Fitbit. But Fitbit is at least trying to give you more insights into what\u2019s going on when you\u2019re sleeping. More importantly, it\u2019s trying to tell you what that means for your overall health.Sleep sessions are now broken down into light sleep, deep sleep, REM stages, and time awake, with a breakdown of your overall sleep quality. There are sleep insights now, too; the app will say \"You were 31% in REM sleep last night\" or \"Light sleep doesn\u2019t mean weak sleep! Your body actually performs a number of important functions during this sleep stage.\" It\u2019s all a little reminiscent of the insights that \u2014 dare I say it \u2014 Jawbone used to offer with its UP activity-tracking system. It\u2019s good to see Fitbit catch up. All of this may seem like I\u2019m feeling fairly non-committal toward the new Fitbit, when in truth I like what Fitbit has done holistically with this product. It\u2019s still the same bracelet-like Fitbit from last year, but with one hardware addition and one new software feature that improve the overall experience. Its battery life lasted me nearly a week, from a Wednesday night to the following Wednesday, on a single charge. This is more impressive when you consider the added heart rate sensors. Over a week, I became a little addicted to Fitbit again, wanting to get my steps up, trying to pay attention to the move reminders, actually checking the app every now and then to see how I slept or what my resting heart rate was that morning. I did miss real exercise-tracking features while I was wearing it, and am still a lot more inclined to buy a wearable that has GPS and other advanced sport tracking.But the new Fitbit Alta HR told me just a tiny bit more about my activity than what I knew before, and was just so easy to wear. And if we aren\u2019t getting mind-blowing technology advances in wearables right now, then that\u2019s probably the next best thing.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R315UUCDSY6Z4R?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Very happy with this purchase.", "review_date": "2017-08-15", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "I am day five into owning/wearing my Fitbit and I love it!

Be aware that you are not only paying for the device, but ongoing support from Fitbit.  I hadn't considered this when I shopped for tracking devices and now think I should have.  I purchased this item directly for the sleep stage information - health wise it has helped me immensely and I am grateful for this, when it works.  But apparently something is wrong with the server, the information is not available, and I am only delivered \"classic sleep\" information, which isn't helpful.  Fitbit acknowledged this problem, eventually, but still offers user troubleshooting advice, even though they know it is a problem with the server.  And, in reading the user posts regarding this disruption, which many, many people are experiencing, I also realize I have been lucky that for the most part my device/sync process works - for others it has not, and although they have purchased a somewhat expensive device with the goal of certain features, that fitbit markets, do not in fact get the benefit of these features.  One user reported that GPS has been down for some time (5+ months) on some models.  And this sleep thing is affecting many of their products, not just the Blaze, which they admitted.  So, if you are buying this for features that will need to use a fitbit server, know that it may not be reliably available.  And this is happening while they are unveiling new products with new features...and not adequately supporting the not-so-old products.  I purchased the relatively new Alta HR in July, and here I am now, not even two months later._____________________________________I am updating this after several days of no fix, and more evidence that the customer service is not taken seriously.  They have indicated that there is a problem with the server, and that is why there are no sleep stages, but they are trying to minimize this by stating it is only limited to one model, when all seem to be affected, and for some reason the customer service people have not been informed, so when customers call to see why their sleep stages are not working they are taken through all the usual stuff (reinstalling app, resetting item, etc.) which takes up time (often the people on the boards report at least an hour) and of course doesn't work because this is not the problem.

For example, from my bed to the bathroom, it is 17 steps, but at 50% power, it says 4 steps.

It won\u2019t count my steps when you hold on, so this also applies to my treadmill exercise.

I am constantly slamming the thing with my knuckle to activate the screen.  Whoever thought this would be a good activation method was....special.  I've also come to loath the band on this thing.  Its either too tight or too loose.  On my Pebble I had a magnetic band that could be adjusted.  I've gone through 3 of these bands and all have only small and large \"large fits my wrist, but can't get around my hand,  resulting in needing to sit there for 2 minutes sliding the band through the loop.  (Apparently these bands are designed in Asia where everyone doesn't have bulkier hands.It wouldn't be a big deal as with my Pebble I only took the thing off once a week, but as this thing is not water resistant and can't take a shower.  I would have to remove it at least once or twice a day.  Its beyond annoying.  Save your money and get something else. The software doesn't make up for the crap hardware design.So once upon a time, I had a Fitbit.  I then went to a Pebble (Which I loved BTW, and was looking forward to the heart rate monitor version)  After the writing was on the wall I went to a Samsung Gear fit 2 (Worse software ever BTW.)  And now I'm back to a Fitbit.  What is frustrating is all the annoyances that were present several years ago and then someBluetooth connectivity issues....check.  (I've upgraded the firmware BTW, and am on a new phone.  Galaxy S8+)lacking water resistance for showers.....check.crappy connector to charge....check  (No really it's almost worse this time around.  The \"clip\"  that you use is hit or miss.  I'm usually futzing around with it.  Last night I thought I had it connected.  Went I went to bed looking at the charge state.....nope.Crappy battery status with low, med, full.....check (I want to know if I'm at 20% or 10%...)But wait.  They have made it worse in some ways.Now lacking a touch screen or a button.  The tapping on the screen is read by the accelerometer.  Which sounds great until you are smashing your finger into the screen over and over to try and trigger it, resulting in rolling past the state you want.  Worse still is a lack of a button.  How do you reset the watch if you are having connectivity issues?  Oh with the charge cable that has a button.  So if you are out and about and need to do a reset, you are SOL.Now both of these changes I could see if the watch was swim and shower resistant.  But without that feature, this just smacks of Fitbit being cheap.Why did I get this if I'm so unhappy with the hardware?  Because of the reverse reason why I dropped my Samsung Fit 2.  Samsung makes great hardware, but crap software.  Fitbit, on the other hand, has bland, almost inferior hardware.  But their software, especially their sleep tracking, makes up for it.....mostly.  It is why it loses only 2 stars.Now I've been seeing people complain that the sleep stages tracking isn't accurate.  I can't speak to that, but I can say the overall time the system sees me asleep looks to be spot on.  And when it sees me awake also looks to be accurate as the last hour before I actually get up where I'm hitting snooze it sees me as awake between the 20 minutes I'm sleeping.  I can't speak to light, deep, and REM sleep without taking a sleep disorder test.  But the feel I'm getting is that it's pretty solid.The steps also seems to be solid.  The miscount as I'm working away on the keyboard at work get up and walk for a bit seems to be spot on.  It doesn't see me moving at my desk with the steps per hour feature, which is a good thing.I've only had this thing for a week.  The battery life appears to be OK.  Nothing fantastic.  Certainly, nothing that matches the Pebble which is the gold standard for battery life. (I was getting close to 10 days on that thing.)  But then again it didn't have a heart rate monitor on it.  So battery life could be considered excellent with that feature set running all the time.  The problem is it's difficult to tell with no actual percentage meter.  Most likely a method for Fitbit to mask actual battery life.The watch band is, like everything else, OK.  The ring that keeps the extra section of the band from flailing around has something that fits into the notch on the band.  The problem is moving this back and forth as you take the watch off to shower or swim is annoying.  Thankfully the bands are stupidly simple to replace.Overall I'd consider the Fitbit Alta HR an OK device.  It's missing key hardware features that should have been included by now.  I believe this speaks to Fitbit tightening its belt as they aren't doing financially well. They may have justicaition for this, it doesn't make for a good device though.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q29TR5P4SMOA?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Good so far.", "review_date": "2019-01-04", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 4, "review_body": "Doing well so far.

I typically put it on the charger while I'm showering or cooking and by the time I'm done it's fully charged (only takes about an hour for charging!)

If you are looking to get serious about tracking steps, heart rate, work-outs, calories, and weight, this is for you. It was a great workout companion and I grew addicted to checking my steps every day and even competing with friends for steps.BUT...and here is the big but...about 2 months ago, I noticed some irritation on my arm where the battery port sat. I didn't think much of it, just that I had maybe been tightening the band too much. I wore it every day, but took it off to shower and about every other night to charge. The only water it came in contact with was maybe when I was washing my hands and when I sweat working out.The irritation did not go away. In fact, the closer I looked at it, it appeared that the battery port had BURNED my arm and was beginning to scar. I googled this issue and it seems many people have in fact had this problem. I contacted Fitbit's customer service, who would not comment on the burn (although I had sent them a photo) but would refund my total amount paid if I would return the Fitbit to them. They also could not guarantee that another Fitbit (a Charge 2 HR for example) wouldn't burn me.TLDR; short story is, the battery port burned my arm and I would not recommend buying this unless you are prepared to accept that eventually the same would happen to you. I'll be buying an Apple Watch as a replacement.

For example, when I use the stairmaster, it reads my heartrate as if I were sitting (around 70 bpm) since my arm is not moving. Walking to the stairmaster it will read it around 90 bpm since my arm is swinging. The stairmaster will read my heart rate at 150+ (And I feel my heart pounding) while the band never registers an increase (actually will decrease). I am very disappointed with this product. I liked having a step counter but I can find that for much cheaper. I have barely had the band for 2 months and yesterday it just stopped working. Doesnt turn on at all.

I've been using a Fitbit tracker for about 2 years.  Overall, I really like the Fitbit trackers.  They are not perfect but for the money way better than other devices I've used.What I like about the Alta HR:  The fit is so much better than the old Charge bands! It fits my wrist well, I like the slimmer profile, and the fact you can change the bands is a real plus. (The band is what split and broke off my first Charge.  Fitbit did send me a new Charge because it was within the warranty period.)  The buckle band is a real plus, too, as the old style band had a habit of falling off.I actually liked the Charge display better, but I am using the Vertical View and could switch to Horizontal View if I want to.  Not only phone calls come across the screen but also text messages, definitely a plus.  Like other devices it reminds you to move, but no longer counts stairs (The Charge really sucked at that anyway so it isn't a loss to me.)All in all the trade off in the slim size for features is totally worth it since the thing lives on my wrist 24/7.  Sleep insights are better, but I find the sleep feature is the least accurate part of the Fitbit line of products.  Bottom line, I would recommend this product.Update:  It is now Feb. 2018 and my Alta is 9 months old.  It has stopped accurately recording my steps!  It records 1/2 of my steps!  I have reset it 3 times, and recalibrate my stride in 100 steps.  It will not sync my manual addition of exercise either.  Calling Fitbit tomorrow while I am still within the warranty period and hopefully they will replace it.  There are a bunch of complaints about this issue answered by Fitbit on the Fitbit website.  Not good!  I have a lot of bands for the Alta so I would like to stay within the slender Alta format. My Charge never did this, the band just broke and it did not have the heart rate monitor.  I am not \"rough\" with my trackers, they never get wet or dropped.

It did track my workouts in the beginning and would tell me how many calories I burned and whether it was fat burning and/or cardio.  That stopped working after less than a month.  I searched review boards for assistance and had no luck coming up with a solution.  I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN OR ANY OTHER FITBIT PRODUCT.

The Alta HR is very slim, looks good with other bracelets on...the customizing menu is a lot simpler than on the Charge 2, there aren't quite as many options and you cannot have the taken steps display when you turn your wrist... which I really miss!It's not the greatest to detect exercise, I really wish it had the manual option like the Charge 2 does... definitely missing the multi-sport functionality!!! It does not connect to your phone's GPS so no tracking on the map where you walk, neither does it detect elevation, aka how many stairs you climb.The Alta HR lies a lot flatter on my wrist, it does not have the bump like the Charge 2 does. It is quite a bit lighter and will come with different kind of straps and bangles (I guess the original Alta accessories fit the HR also).The rest of the stuff seem to be pretty much the same as on the Charge 2...tracks sleep the same, heart rate is the sameso I guess it depends on what functions you are looking to have and if you're willing to compromise the size/accessories vs functions!I use both, the Alta HR during the day (work, outing etc) and at night, and the Charge 2 during workouts...If this review has helped you in any way, please click the YES button.

However, the main reason I bought it was for how many calories I burned while exercising.  Which is where this Fitbit falls short.  *I am aware that no fitness tracker is 100% accurate and is to be used as a guide.PROS:1) Sleep tracker is really cool! (Again, not 100% accurate but still useful)2) Heart rate monitor seems to be pretty accurate--I tried it with multiple machines at my gym and they were within 1 digit of each other (ex: 129/130)3) Fitbit Community Forum is helpful!4) Still connects to my phone even at work, I am usually between 30-50 feet away from it.CONS:1) Tracking (real time) exercises only gives 3 options: walking, running, and hiking. Any other exercises you'll need to use auto-tracking.2) Auto-tracking exercises works about 60% of the time.  You need to have a consistent heart rate for at least 15 min (you can adjust it to 10) but it will sometimes only save part of your exercises *after* you hit that 10/15 min mark.  For the times it doesn't auto-track you have to manually enter your exercises.3) When manually entering exercises, the \"calories burned\" are *not based off of your own data* it is based on a population average. (found this out from fitbit community) I noticed that it was saying I burned way more calories for some exercises than what was possible, (ex: said I burned over 600 calories for jogging 30 min on a treadmill).  The amount of calories burned was the main reason why I bought it, and I was so angry when I found out it was based off an estimate rather than my own data.  Seriously? Did I pay over $100 for an estimate? I can do that crap myself for FREE.*Again, I am aware that no fitness tracker is 100% accurate, and should be used as a guide, but again if it's based off an estimate and not my data then it's useless to me.I tried different suggestions from the Fitbit community to hopefully fix my issues, but unfortunately, nothing worked. (if you have an android you might have a chance)After this I decided to return my Alta HR in exchange for a Charge 2 HR.

I went back and forth among several of the Fitbit styles before deciding on this one for my second tracker. Previously I had the clip-on Zip, but I wanted to upgrade, and I'm quite happy with this one!!One of the big reasons I decided on this particular style was that it had the HR monitor but it wasn't bulky. I really like the streamlined look of the Alta. It looks more like a watch than a fitness device.Also, with the HR feature, I now use sleep tracking, heart rate zones and resting daily heart rate to make my fitness goals a little more well rounded instead of solely focusing on getting in my steps for the day. I think the HR feature also gives a more accurate calorie burning calculator too.The one downfall is that the automatic exercise recognition is not as good as I was hoping it would be. Many times it does not recognize my workouts. For instance, if I'm on the treadmill with the incline really high...my heart rate is borderline cardio/peak, but since I'm holding onto the bars instead of swinging my arms, the tracker doesn't recognize that I am working out. Really?? I would think the elevated heart rate would be enough for recognition, but apparently not. I have to manually enter many of my workouts, but as long as I keep careful track of the times, the readouts still match up pretty well.Besides the drawback of automatic exercise recognition, I am very pleased with the purchase. It's cute, not obnoxious looking like some of the bigger fitness trackers, and it's making me more conscious of other areas of my health besides just my movement alone.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38KDCJBQPG7U5?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}], [{"review_title": "Uncomfortable to sleep with", "review_date": "2018-04-02", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 3, "review_body": "Great app but lacking features that Jawbone had.

When this new Alta HR came out I knew I wanted to upgrade. I don't usually go for the newest, latest, greatest model of anything but I felt like this would be worth it and it was. I love the color and the style of the screen. The size works for me but I keep it on the second hold in on the band so I could've gone with the small and it would have been fine. I bought a large because that's what I had before. I really like getting a glimpse of my text messages on the screen. The charge hr didn't have that and it's a real time saver when I can't access my phone and I want to know if the text was really important or not. I don't really miss the button on the side like the Charge HR has as much as I thought I might. I wasn't using it much anymore on my workouts anyway so I could get a more accurate picture of what my body was really doing. I have had a problem with it not recording my runs sometimes but that happened with the Charge HR as well so maybe it's a general Fitbit software problem. I love the fact that the band is interchangeable. My old one wasn't like that. I bought a rose gold leather band to dress it up sometimes. Easy to change out. I clean it from time to time with Aquanil. I use a pipe cleaner to get the holes clean. I like that the time and date pop on screen when you flick your wrist towards you. My other one did that and I was happy when this had that feature too. I find the display bright enough most of the time. I look at my fitbit app more than the actual fitbit itself unless I want to know the time or date. I've gotten it wet without any issues. Same with my Charge HR. I actually wore that in the pool once on accident and dried it off quick when I realized it. No problems whatsoever. This is a high quality product. Glad they had this in fuchsia. My charge hr is purple and both of these are really nice colors. They aren't super bright and go with everything just fine. I bought the screen protectors from IQ Shield and just left a review about how mediocre they are. I really felt like I needed to protect this larger screen and they do the job. You just use up half the package putting them on wrong because they don't provide instructions. I lost 20 lbs. with the help of my Charge HR last year and kept it off!

Face lights up only if you tilt the band towards you or if you double-tap the screen. This model is not waterproof and should not be used in say a swimming pool, but is said to be water resistant. Lastly, this device is compatible with other phone models besides just an iPhone unlike the Apple Watch.

Great customer support.There is absolutely no Alta HR Fitbit support for stationary cycling, and marginal support for on-road biking. The app allows you to \"Track exercise\" only if it is hiking, walking, or running. Nothing else. No bikes, horseback riding, tennis, golf, swimming.I looked in Fitbit's online community for help and this shortcoming has been an issue for years. Fitbit has done nothing to support indoor riding\u2014or logging outdoor cycling with the app using the iPhone's GPS. This would be a great way to capture heart rate with GPS, but no.The Alta HR is supposed to automatically recognize outdoor bike rides. But there is no way to initiate and track any kind of ride, indoors or out, via the app. If you aren't tracking with the app, you're not capturing GPS. And tracking stationary cycling is completely out of the question. All you will see is that your heart rate rose for a period of time without explanation.Need to track bike riding?

Turns out it gets better when I take the fit bit off. Not right away, but a few days without it and it feels better. I put it back on and voila - the shocks are back!I wasn't a fan of wearing this thing all the time, so I stopped wearing it at night in the beginning because I wasn't sleeping well with it on. Now I can't even wear it! What a waste of money.

The Fitbit app (that this works with) shows highest and lowest HR of the day, and you can fairly well determine the timing of peaks and lows. I also like the smaller size, smallest HR wrist monitor than anything else I have found. The bands are easily changeable, which is nice. The only reason I took away a star is because this really doesn't have any kind of water resistance at all, and the instructions say to remove until your arm and the fitbit are completely dry.

This doesn't bother me a lot but if it would bother you definitely buy a screen protector before you start wearing it- Screen can be hard to see outside in certain light- HR function sometimes doesn't read during very intense exercise. I admit this really disappointed me when I first got it but it picks up HR enough during exercise that I decided to go ahead and keep it.- The battery has never lasted longer than about 3-4 days for me and this is with cell phone alerts off.- Warning that if you ride a motorcycle it will log it as \"Cycling\" exercise automatically. I haven't found a way to fix this except to just manually delete it after it logs it.These few issues haven't prevented me from enjoying my new Alta. I wear it every day and really enjoy the hourly reminders to move and the constant logging of my HR. The band is comfortable and easy to clean. I don't use the sleep function because I don't like to sleep with the Fitbit on but that feature also is useful for the right people.

As I write this, the Sleep Analysis feature is not working. The reason it does not work is yet another major disappointment which I consider False Advertising by Fitbit. First: the sleep analysis feature is not working because fitbit has a bug in there programming (reported to me by a fitbit customer service person and their supervisor). It has been down for a few days now, even though it had been working fine for the first 8 days since I purchased the Alta . The second problem, and very important for some people, is that you get none of the functionality described for this tracker unless you are connected to the INTERNET !!!! That right: it is not enough to have the Fitbit app on your device (telephone, tablet, or computer). That devise must be connected to the Internet at the time you sync your tracker and for several minutes thereafter. So if you are not somewhere with internet, there is NO syncing gonna happen and there is nothing this tracker can do but collect data (they say for up to 7 days) and tell time plus a few other really basic things. If the Fitbit app was stand-alone, as they strongly imply in all their marketing material, there would be no problem with the Sleep Analysis. But the app does not do the analysis. It only communicates all your data back to Fitbit where the calculations are performed. Like I said, without internet ---- nothing.There are plenty of reviews which say what is good about the Alta, and mostly I agree. The false representation of the product is just a big deal for me. And the company has a reputation for exaggerating the capabilities of their products. Even the Fitbit website \"community area\" has many problems noted by customers and the company's response is a variation on \"yes, this feature is not working\" or \"this feature is not working yet\".", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q79NWZ7FLPYT?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Five Stars", "review_date": "2018-04-10", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "Gift for wife and she really likes it.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XPB0JKH63R4K?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "AWESOME FITNESS TRACKER", "review_date": "2018-02-03", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "AWESOME FITNESS TRACKER...", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1I5KTZ7040GVC?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "not good about tracking heart rate", "review_date": "2018-05-16", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 2, "review_body": "Much less reliable than previous Fitbit monitors.

However, it is awful for tracking exercise if you do any exercise other than the ones automatically recognized. It gets long walks without a problem but when I do my regular workout (Daily Burn,) it rarely gets it, and if it does it is inaccurate. Some examples - I did a particularly vigorous workout the other day and it recognized 0 active minutes. Today, another vigorous 40 minute workout, including a ton of burpees and it gave me 23 active minutes. When I manually add the workout I get no information on calories burned. I have been following the conversation on the Fitbit community message boards (this seems to be a common problem,) and tried all of the recommendations from Fitbit to no avail (resetting it multiple times, deleting the app and downloading it again, etc etc.) It's basically useless to me for what I need it to do.

No place to record why I did so little that day.Have really amped up activity.  Heart information helpful with my history.  Learned I am well below normal on deep sleep, which not surprising given chronic fatigue syndrome. Started tracking food intake 7/6/17.Wish it logged all nutrition information.  It only tracks calories and %carbs, fat and protein.  Need separate app if want to track say sodium intake. Or, protein intake to make sure am not getting too much and end up damaging my kidneys.  Too much protein increases appetite; don't want that either. Obviously can't track sugars, carbs, potassium, etc.Update 9/15/18:Warning:  All your info goes online to Fitbit including everything you log (food intake, water consumption,  and weight.  Also daily exercise, cardiac, steps and sleep patterns.  No apparent way to block the routine uploads of this private/personal info as I have done with all my other apps.

They show a lot of people in their advertising running, so I want to make clear to others using it for running purposes:1. This watch cannot really track your runs. It will autotrack anytime you walk for more than 15 minutes (you can adjust this) but it can't show you start and stop point because there is no way to tell it when you started running. I.e if you walk to the track and start running, that's all one exercise. Cannot be used for pacing for this reason2. This watch does NOT have GPS. This is on me for not doing my research, but to be fair, I don't feel that their website or descriptions make this very clear. Alta and every Fitbit except the $300 does not have a GPS. It uses your phone's GPS and tells you where you went with your phone. It can't tell you distances, etc without your phone being nearby.So basically- if you have any standard iPhone (I have a 5), every single feature except heart rate and more is right there in your pocket. There is no point in owning a Fitbit Alta if you have an iPhone and are the type of person to be with your phone a lot.I returned after 1 day and am purchasing a Garmin 35. I wish Fitbit would make a sleek looking running watch (I know there is one, but it is expensive and huge). They have the style down that none of these other companies who do GPS watches seem to capture. $130 for this is a waste.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P10LR20C8WDL?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Five Stars", "review_date": "2017-09-10", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "Love it", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26TQTMAX1YKE4?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Five Stars", "review_date": "2018-04-05", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "Works great, Wife loves it.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ARO84N88C1Z0?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}], [{"review_title": "Five Stars", "review_date": "2017-05-04", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "Very functional but the strap gets dirty so easily so I will get a darker colour", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G60M0S9NNATQ?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "love it", "review_date": "2017-10-17", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "So happy that I upgraded from an older model Fitbit.

It really gives me an incentive to work out. I hardly ever worked out before I got it, but being able to set goals for how many days I should be working out a week, and seeing those days go up as I work out is a simple, but almost crazily effective incentive. I've worked out more in the past three weeks than I had probably the whole rest of the year. I love seeing stats about the exercise I've been doing, even if I'm not entirely convinced that the calories are correct, it still gives me something to compare other exercise days to. I love the heartrate fuction, and seeing it rise and fall depending on what kind of exercise you're doing, and my bpm has steadily fallen as I've done more exercise, which is encouraging to see.I do wish that it would count stairs, but I don't really miss it, and it's not a terribly important feature, just a small thing. It counts your steps on the stairs, just not the floors of stairs you walk up, and the steps are really the most important part. One other thing I wish was slightly better is the battery. I feel like I have to charge it every couple of days, even though the package says that it should work for a full week without needing another charge. Either way, it's not a huge problem, just something I think could be improved upon.It looks great, it works well. and it provides a simple incentive to work out more and to make the active choice throughout your day.

In using my new Alta HR was less than 2 weeks i notice that it does NOT perform the way it should.  The screen is meant to come on if you turn your wrist to look at it, but it only does so one out of every 15 times or so.  In addition you're supposed to be able to get the screen to come on by a double tap.  This only works one out of every 10 times.  Typically I had to tap a good 30 times just to get any response and then it only comes on for a split second and is so fast you can't even read what was on it.  I did days worth of tech chat with FB and discovered that i was wearing it correctly, and that shutting it down did not help at all.  FB did offer to send a new one, but since I'm a long time FB customer I know they will only do this one time for each watch....so I am instead choosing to return it to Amazon to receive a refund so i can purchase a different one all together.  Prior to this Alta HR I owned a Surge and throughout its life I had many problems yet FB wouldn't assist with exchange as they had already done so once.

I was ecstatic! It was on pre-order so when they let me know that it had shipped out, I was even more excited. I received it in the mail today and it looked exactly like the photo, I was in love with it and setting it up was even easy! After wearing it for 8 hours, the edges of the band turned black! It did not look appealing and it not look pretty anymore! This was a BRAND NEW BAND that they just came out with and it turned black! I reached out to their customer service via chat and at first, the customer rep \"Marlon\" told me that I didn't need to return it to the warehouse because it was just an issue with the band and that I can keep it. Then she comes back to tell me that I have to return my band before I can receive the replacement and that I was responsible for shipping their defective band! She also told me not to wear dark clothing and I didn't even have dark clothing on and why can't I wear dark clothing? I even tried to wash it off but it wouldn't come off so it was definitely an issue with the band. So I love the thing and how it works but I am not happy that I will have to provide shipping and be without a FitBit for 10-20 days! That is ridiculous! I've included pictures for you all to look at. I just got it today and it already is stained. Do not get it! You will end up with a black wristband after a week, I'm sure and pay more shipping and handling to get the replacement. Wasted my time and money! The Rose gold edition also cost more and I don't know why because obviously the quality is lacking!

I've also owned a series of Garmin GPS watches I use for running.I was torn with the idea of getting an Apple watch - do it all on one device, but ultimately decided against it as I'm not looking for the extra distraction, and I've been actually trying to without a watch (part of the minimalism exercise).I found the Alta HR the perfect compromise - it is minimal as you can make it, and the HR function has really been a game changer for me.

I decided to upgrade to the Fitbit Alta HR since it was easier to track sleep and could distinguish different levels of sleep.  This feature is working well on the Alta HR.  I would give the Alta HR a 5-star rating, but it falls short in measuring steps.  Recently while at the grocery store, the Alta HR only gave me about 50 steps while pushing a buggy up and down many isles of the large store.  I also noted that using a treadmill while holding the bars short changes me by about 40% of the steps that I would get with the Fitbit One doing the same treadmill routine.  One day before starting my standard treadmill routine, I took the Alta HR off of my wrist and put it in my gym pants.  The number of steps was almost exactly what I was expecting based on my Fitbit One experience.  In conclusion, I am somewhat disappointed that the new Fitbit doesn't always count steps when the arm is not in motion.  The counter is accurate if I wear it in my pocket, however.Update:  After using the Alta HR for about a month, I have changed my rating from 3 to 2 stars.  The sleep tracking is the best, most accurate function.  Steps are not counted correctly unless the device is in my pocket when pushing a buggy or holding on to a treadmill while walking.  Of course, when I place it in my pocket I loose an accurate heart rate.  The heart rate then tends to jump to very high levels and the Alta then thinks that I'm very active and largely over counts my active minutes.  Overall, I am now disappointed and wish that I would have stayed with my old Fitbit One.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ACAU0T0308PO?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Great buy", "review_date": "2017-07-20", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "I love my fitbit and wear it daily.

I am in Weight Watchers and it also syncs to my Weight Watchers app and logs my exercise points.

Their support is helpful, but you get a different person everytime in the same email thread which meant, I had to provide the same information sometimes, I had to follow up because I didn't receive a response, etc. Then, after doing everything they needed, I shipped out the defective Fitbit to find out it would take almost a month to get a new one ! If I did this thru Amazon, I knew they would've handled my issue quickly. I explained this to Fitbit and they were able to expedite my Fitbit. I still haven't received as I am typing this. I should be by tomorrow or the next day I believe. I'm frustrated because I was so excited to use the product in itself but then had to go thru all of this. For the short time I did use the product, it was really cool ! I'm not sure how accurate the heart was, and I'm kinda bummed it doesn't calculate the flights like the Charge does but oh well.

There is no documentation.  One needs to surf the web and wade through phone and app settings to get something as simple as text message notifications to work.  Hmm, they still don't work.  WTF.  No idea.  Oh, and no email notifications either.Previously I had a Garmin Vivosmart HR and the main thing I used it for was to track an activity, and secondarily to monitor heart rate.  I could start it at the beginning of a walk or hike and could see how far I'd gone.  If the hike was say 8 miles and I'd gone 6, I'd know what's left to do.  The info was there, on the device, on my wrist.  This doesn't do that.  I don't always want to carry my phone and be looking at it.  I don't know but I think that's my option.  Even then it's 'auto-start' so who knows when it begins.  At the trail head?  I'll guess not.  I obviously I didn't do enough research before purchasing.  I read comparisons with the Charge 2, which has a GPS and can map your activity.  The review implied to me that with the Alta I just couldn't map it, not that I couldn't even track it.So frustrated and disappointed.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ANTJA6NGUASJ?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Four Stars", "review_date": "2018-04-27", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 4, "review_body": "I wish it would show the steps on it instead of the bars on the band", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O8B5ORL7KJLN?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Five Stars", "review_date": "2017-09-19", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "Wife loves it", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSZJCBUGJWU2P?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Painful on my wrist", "review_date": "2017-05-18", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_rating": 2, "review_body": "I really wanted to like this but it is too painful to wear.

I originally had a Fitbit Flex but wanted to upgrade to something with a heart rate monitor to track my resting heart rate and my heart rate during cardio to ensure I was reaching my target zones1. Appearance - I bought the Gunmetal Special Edition tracker as I liked the way the black on black looked. It appears very stylish and looks higher quality than my Fitbit Flex that I had prior to this one2. Display - I like the options for the display as I have the convenience of a watch and my heart rate at first glance. I can also see my battery level, steps taken and distance by tapping on the display. I will say though that the display took a little getting used to. You are supposed to tap the screen twice to get the initial display and then tap it again to scroll to the other screens. I am so used to swiping on a touch screen to progress to the next page that I had to stop and remember that the Fitbit did not work that way. Also sometimes you can tap it to wake it up and nothing happens. It seems like you have to tap it just right to get it to wake up3. Step tracker - Just as accurate as the Fitbit Flex I had4. Heart rate monitor - This is where things get a little tricky. My resting heart rate seems to be pretty accurate (I compared it to manually calculating my heart rate as I did not have another device to compare it to). However, I've found it is not very accurate when doing cardio, depending on what type of workout you do. I did a lot of research before buying this product as this was my main reason for upgrading. Everything I read stated that Fitbit claims it has accuracy within 6 bpm. However other reviews stated that the more complex the workout (where your arm does more inconsistent moving) would throw it off a lot. I've tested this on three different machines at the gym and compared them to the machines heart rate monitors. I know that the heart rate monitors that are built into the machines at the gym can be inaccurate but it was the best thing I had to compare it to. On the step machine, it is off by A LOT. My heart rate on the machine shows an average of 157 bpm but the Fitbit will only show on average of 86 bpm and sometimes it wouldn't even register. That's a huge difference. I've also tried wearing it on different wrists and on different positions on my wrist to improve the accuracy but nothing seems to help. The instructions state that you are to wear it about two to three fingers width from your wrist bone while working out to get the most accurate results. Tried that too but it did nothing while on the stair machine. I will say however that when I compare it to the rowing machine and treadmill, the Fitbit is only about 3 bpm different from what the machine says. Just be aware that depending on the type of workout you do will affect its accuracy. I'm also not thrilled where it has to sit on my arm/wrist to get an accurate reading as it's not a natural place where you would wear a watch/tracker but I'm starting to get used to it5. Charging cable - I'm not thrilled about this design. The best way to describe the charging cable is that it is a butterfly clip that attaches to the back of your device but you have to line up two metal pins exactly or else it will not connect right. Feels very clumsy and cheaply made6. Band - The band seems to be higher quality than the standard one that comes with the Fitbit Flex. The one on my Flex had to be replaced every couple of months as it would rip from having to take out the sensor to charge it. I don't think I will have the same problem here but only time will tell. The clasp is also higher quality on this one7. Heart rate zones - I really do like this feature. I have my Fitbit linked to MyFitness Pal and it accurately shows me what portion of my workouts are cardio vs. fat burn. As long as you are accurate when entering your start time and duration in MyFitness Pal, I feel like this will be accurate for most workouts. However, due to the Fitbit Alta HR not accurately tracking my heart rate during my workout on the stairs, I don't have that data for those workouts which is disappointing to me8. Sleep cycles - One great upgrade is how they track your sleep cycles. My Fitbit Flex tracked how many hours slept, restless minutes and times awake. With the Fitbit Alta HR it does that plus tracks your deep sleep and REM sleep which was huge for me. My Fitbit Flex was showing on most nights that I got enough sleep. However I would still feel tired most days when waking up. With the Fitbit Alta HR, I found out that even-though I was getting 8 hours of sleep a night only 12% of my sleep was a deep sleep and 3% was REM sleep. Everything else was light sleep. According to my doctor and the research I did, you should have about 25% deep sleep and 20% REM sleep per night. No wonder why I was so tired all the time. I am not sure how to fix this quite yet but I think the data will be helpful when talking to my doctor about ways to fix it9. Alerts and notifications - I like the feature of getting my call and text notifications on the screen. It is also great with text messages that you can select the option to see who the text is from and at least the first part of the text message. It helps me when doing cardio because I can see if it is something that can wait to respond to or if I need to stop and address it right away. Also if I have my Do Not Disturb on, it won't alert me. However I have found that this feature does not always work correctly. Sometimes it just vibrates but gives me no indication if it is a text or call and if it is a text, who it is from. I really wish this could be more consistent. Also, if you are on your phone doing something else (like reading an e-mail), it won't give you a notification. This is something I wish it would do as it would prevent me from having to stop what I am doing to toggle to my text messages but I guess that is just laziness on my part10. Silent Alarms - I still can't get these to work correctly. I have set three so far to test it but none have gone off.

I ordered this just before midnight and had it by the early afternoon the next day.Regarding the product...There are a lot of things I love about the Fitbit: the tracking of activity, calories, sleep, etc. all in one place is fantastic.  As someone who has always struggled with sleep, I've found the sleep tracking really interesting.  And I love that it syncs with my phone for text, calendar and call notifications (as long as it's in range).  That said, I haven't not transformed into a significantly fitter person.  Obviously this cannot actually work out or prepare healthy meals for me (that would help), but it has made me more aware of how inactive I have been and the child in me is thrilled when I get a notification that I've met one of my goals.  So it has helped a bit with motivation.Now that I've had this a few months, I do see some of the same problems I'd read in other reviews.  The coral band is grey and dirty around the edges and will not come off no matter how much I've cleaned it.  The other issue I've had is with the comfort.  I had been wearing this virtually 24/7 and found that my wrist and forearm started to ache (I wear it very loose as they suggest, so it's not an issue of being too tight).  I've started taking the band off a lot more, particularly when I sleep, or switching wrists, but obviously that kind of defeats the purpose of wearing a tracker in the first place.  Finally, the tracking is not always consistent, and I find that on the rare occasions I do intense cardio, the Fitbit doesn't pick up my heart rate at all.Overall, although I really like the technology, I would probably try a different version of the Fitbit that is more comfortable to wear.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30ID5EOOPX2YE?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Four Stars", "review_date": "2018-03-26", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 4, "review_body": "Works great", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38RDN4FETPHQ3?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Five Stars", "review_date": "2017-12-11", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "GREAT!!", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28HSKG0MOI3M9?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Great", "review_date": "2017-05-06", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "Works great for what I need.

Both are reasonably accurate HR monitors, though neither can compare to a chest strap.My opinion is that if the fitness tracker is consistently higher or lower than the strap, that's great for a wrist monitor.  I liked the UP3 because it used impedance to track HR rather than optical.  But UP is kind of a dead end since they are no longer manufactured.Fitbit has always had the best infrastructure.

A couple of things I would have liked to see: the charger clasp is more secure but it seems cheaply made. I'm paranoid I'm going to break it.

Community discussion indicates others are also having problems. Instead of providing useful instructions, they give you tips. Save that for later and help me get this thing to work!Revision one week later: Online instructions were incomplete, but I eventually got sleep stages to work. Then after three days, it wouldn't sync any more. The problem was Bluetooth, but the instruction to turn Bluetooth off and on, resetting Fitbit, is incomplete. Ultimately got it to work.Bottom line: if you are frustrated as I am about nonverbal pictographic instructions that assume everything works right and is intuitively obvious, Google Fitbit support, call the number, and a helpful person from halfway around the world will help you solve your problem step-by-step.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DHEM2AJ0FM1X?ASIN=B06W58QKH6"}, {"review_title": "Love the Fitbit Alta HR", "review_date": "2017-07-27", "article": "Fitbit Alta HR, Black, Small (US Version)", "price": 124.99, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_rating": 5, "review_body": "I had a Fitbit Alta that I really liked but when they came out with the Fitbit Alta HR I just had to try it.

If there are other fit bits in the household, Note: You will need a separate e mail for each if you want stats and want to sync.

Also if you change models and want another family member to start fresh (i.e. wipe out old data) you will also need their help. The Alta HR does not have the same charger plug in as the Alta.

No I didn't take it off, it's fully charged and I didn't do anything weird with it.  And it's done it again later in the day.  Doesn't make me happy for something brand new that I paid $150 for.

The app is amazing however it won't sync with Apple Health, but that doesn't matter to me. Unlike the Jawbone Up bands that I used in the past, this strap seems tougher and even if they do break off, they're replaceable without having to buy a new unit altogether. I like the smoky blue-gray bands for now and they look unique. Do note that when navigating the screen, you'll need to tap somewhere below the Fitbit logo for best response though.
