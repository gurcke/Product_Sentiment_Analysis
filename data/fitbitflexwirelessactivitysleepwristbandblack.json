[[{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-01-11", "review_body": "Update 12/8/15 - Fitbit just added a new firmware update for the sleep timer feature. Once updated it's no longer necessary to tap the Fitbit before going to sleep or when waking it. It will now recognize when you're inactive and have gone to sleep. It also has some new goal setting software in the app relating to sleep to make it easier to focus on getting more (or less) sleep. The graphic interface is pretty nice. I'm looking forward to using this since I've become something of a night owl and could really stand to get on a better schedule. One more thing to like about my Fitbit.The update took about 5 minutes using my iPad and plugging my Fitbit into its charger while it updated. The whole thing was simple. A red arrow on the dashboard, in the sync area alerted me to the upgrade. I really like this new feature.I  bought 3 of these fitbit flex devices, one for myself, my husband and my sister. Before purchasing I researched several wristband devices such as the Jawbone UP, the Nike Fuel and and the Polar Loop. I also looked at the fitbit force which is a newer version of this band. The lack of water resistance on the force was a deal breaker for me. I wanted to be able to wear this band 24/7 and to be able to wear it in the shower or when swimming. That was part of what made it attractive to me. Also, after reading reviews about the clasp problems on the force and how many people lost them, I wanted no part of that. They are also quite a bit bigger and look clunckier.  The wristband on the UP looked like it would catch on everything and had no display at all. The Polar had lots of quality problems. I wasn't crazy about the looks of the Nike. The display is nice and I can see how people would like them, but not my style. The fitbit flex, to my tastes, had the coolest look. I also know a couple of people who own the fitbit flex and they were very enthusiastic about them so that influenced me as well.So here is what I like about the flex: I like the way it looks on my wrist. All of us got the slate color. You can also order bands in a few different colors, both here and on the Fitbit site.  It is lightweight and even though I don't often wear a watch I don't notice this on my wrist at all. The clasp was VERY difficult to secure the first couple of times until the rubber softened up a bit and until I got the hang of it. I secured it off of my wrist a couple times when it was new. Making sure the band and clasps are lined up correctly and then placing one finger directly below the clasp and my thumb directly above and squeezing hard was the way to do it.I like that it's water resistant and that I can wear it swimming or in the shower. It is safe down to 10 meters or around 30 feet. I like that the wristband is made of TPU rubber, which according to Wikipedia is a type of rubber used in automotive instrument panels, caster wheels, power tools, sporting goods, medical devices, drive belts, footwear, inflatable rafts, and a variety of extruded film, sheet and profile applications. I think it should hold up for a very long time. I like that the display on the band gives me a rough idea by tapping on it of my progress throughout the day. I can also check my progress on my iPhone 4S and see number of steps so far, calories burned, how many hours of sleep I got last night and how often I woke up or was restless. So far it seems very accurate. I can also track the foods I've eaten and the calories, my weight goals and weight lost, check on the weekly number of steps friend's with Fitbits have taken and compare them with my own.I like that I can wear it 24/7 and only have to take it off to charge it once every 7 days. It takes about 3 hours to charge with a USB thingie that comes with it. I use a wall adapter to charge it but could also use a USB port on my desktop or laptop computer. I've lost too many pedometers in the past by dropping them out of my pockets or forgetting about them and sending them through the washing machine, so the wristband seems like a much better option for me. I also like that I can connect wirelessly with my smartphone and with the little dongle included that goes into my desktop or laptop, can connect with those wirelessly as well. Software downloads for all of these are free. I'm also able to connect on my first gen Kindle HD 8.9 although I can't see where it's shown as a supported device so far. But it works with the Android fitbit software in the app store.The step measurements seem reasonably accurate. Waving my hand slowly won't register as a step. Waving wildly will. Driving in the car won't register but reaching around quickly in the car sometimes will. Typing on the computer or Kindle won't register. I've heard that swimming doesn't register either but you can input the time and activity on your phone or tablet.  When I first got the flex I started the iPhone app and watched my steps register on my screen as I walked around the house. That, and watching my steps on the treadmill have shown it to be pretty accurate for me, although not perfect. I think that all pedometers have some inaccuracies. What I'm looking for is a comparative trend where I can tell how much exercise I'm getting. The accuracy is good enough for me.So I wake up in the morning, tap the wristband quickly a few times to tell it I'm awake. Then if I tap it twice I see one tiny blinking light, telling me I'm working on my first 2,000 steps. Later, when I've hit that mark and tap to check again, I'll see one solid light and the second one blinking. There are 5 lights total and each represents 2,000 steps (or 20% of my goal. I could set it up differently on my computer, using a different number of steps as my daily goal if I wanted to.) So I can see my approximate progress any time during the day.  When I hit my goal of 10,000 steps the band vibrates and all the lights flash. That means you done good!I can set up to 8 silent vibrating alarms on this fltbit. I have one to wake me up on weekdays (you can specify which days) and one at 8:00 each night to remind me stop eating for the day. The vibration gets my attention and is effective at waking me up. I set the alarms on my computer or phone.At night when I'm in bed and ready to go to sleep I tap the wristband rapidly a few times, it vibrates briefly, and goes into the sleep mode until I wake it again in the morning.So am I happy that I purchased the Fitbits for myself and my family members? Yes I am. It motivates me to walk or run more. I can connect to other friends and family with Fitbits to see everyone's weekly step progress but what really motivates me is just competing against myself. I'll find myself parking in the back of the parking lots at stores to log those extra steps or walking around the store longer because it's a good way to add even more. When I haven't reached my goal at night, I'll sometimes walk around the house several times just to hit a number. Now that can't be all bad, can it?Update 1/12/14 - I'll keep updating this review with comments and observations as I use this device. I noticed that walking at a rapid pace is counted as \"active minutes\". Someone on a message board suggested adding a touch of lotion to the clasp if you're having trouble getting it to clasp when it's new.Update 1/16/14 - A full charge is lasting just a bit over 7 days. It takes about 3 hours to recharge it fully.Update 1/21/14 - Some people have complained about this band coming undone and losing it. I haven't had any problems with it at all, even when pulling tight coat and shirt sleeves over it, brushing my arm against things or the dog pulling on it once or twice. (I'm sure the dog could have pulled it off if I didn't stop him.) The other day I had the dog's leash wrapped around the wrist with the Fitbit and even with the dog pulling against the leash the fitbit stayed on. We walked this way a couple of miles before I noticed it and unwrapped the leash from my wrist. But even with all that agitation my fitbit stayed put. It has stayed on through enough that I'm not very concerned about losing it. I've only taken it off to charge it. I have the band snug enough that I can only put one finger beneath the band but I can move it a couple of inches back and forth on my wrist.Update 7/3/14 - A new update that works with iPhones that use the Fitbit app was released a few days ago. I've used it with my iPhone 4S and really like the new upgrade. It adds a whole new dimension to my Fitbit app. With the upgrade, I just click on the exercise icon on the dashboard which takes me to a new screen showing the days of the week that I've exercised. (Meaning a walk, run or hike, something in addition to the regular walking in my daily activities.) This screen shows exercise frequency by day of the week, it puts a check on the days that you do some planned exercise. If I click the little stopwatch in the upper right-hand corner, it takes me to a screen where I can click Walk, Run, or Hike. I go back and can then click Cues which takes me to another screen where I can select whether or not I want to hear spoken cues. I can also tell it which cues I want including: Distance, Time, Average Pace, Split Pace, and Calories Burned. Then I go back again an can select the frequency of the cues from every .5 miles to every 5 miles.  Or, I can make the cues time based ranging from every 2 minutes, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 minutes. I can also select the volume of the cues. (Medium was perfect for me.) Then, back again to select a playlist from my iPhone's loaded tunes. Last, I allowed location services for Fitbit in my phone settings and I was ready to go. Now I see a big red circle with a Start arrow on the screen over a GPS map showing my location. I pop in my earphones, click Start and my music starts playing.As I walk, I can see a screen showing how far I've walked, rate per mile, time elapsed. Every half mile a voice interrupts my music telling me how far I've gone and all the other things I've specified in Cues that I wanted to know. Then it goes back to playing my music until it's time for my next designated Cue. How cool is that? It works seamlessly. At the end of my walk I tell it I'm finished (or I could also pause it if I stop to talk to a neighbor or something). When I'm finished (or even during the walk or run) I can see a little red line  showing my route on the map. The steps from my walk are added to my steps count, just as they always are. I love these new features. They add a lot to the Fitbit experience.For those of you who track calories and foods eaten in the Fitbit app, the update now includes a bar code scanner. So far, the things I've scanned have been in their database. If you don't see the bar code symbol in the upper right-hand corner of the Log Food screen, log out of the Fitbit app and then log back in and it should be there.Update 11/28/14 - If something happened to ithis Fitbit today, what would I replace it with? Another one just like it. If one of the new Fitbit models was interchangeable with it on a daily basis I might get one of those too, just because I like new technology. But this one would be my main fitness band. I would like having a watch built in, but then it would look kind of silly wearing a conventional watch on the other arm. And I have a lot of nice watches.Update 12/12/14 - I just noticed today that the Fitbit Flex is the #1 Best Seller on Amazon this holiday season. It does seem like when I see people wearing fitness bracelets, this is the one they're most often wearing. A lot of the competitors have lowered prices significantly on their devices which is probably the best indicator of all. It's nice to know that I'm not the only Fitbit fan after wearing it for nearly a year. :)Update 12/26/14 - My Fitbit looks all new for the holidays. This replacement bracelet took over 20 days to arrive but for about $2 it was worth the wait.1pc Small S Black with White Dots Spots Replacement Band With Clasp for Fitbit FLEX Only /No tracker/ Wireless Activity Bracelet Sport Wristband Fit Bit Flex Bracelet Sport Arm Band Armband\u00a0A couple people have asked me how the bands hold up over time. I have to tell them that I don't know since I'm wearing different colored ones almost every day. They don't have much of a chance to show wear.After almost a year of wearing these 24/7, none of us have had one come off accidentally. Even the cheap knock-off bands seem sturdy and reliable like the original. And I'm not a very careful person about pulling tight sleeves over it or draping grocery bag handles over my arm.I have the steps across our back patio counted out by counting them myself. It is 60 steps back and forth once. (Yeah, I know, way too anal.) Oftentimes when I haven't hit my 10,000 steps for the day, I'll go out and walk back and forth with my iPad on the patio table to check my progress. I know from doing this that the Fitbit step count is dead-on accurate for counting steps when walking. Dancing will add steps which I think is fair since it's at least as good as walking for exercise.Update 1/30/15 - I can't believe I've had my Fitbit Flex for over a year already. I'm still wearing it 24/7 as a great motivator to keep moving. I've had several people email me with questions about the way it counts steps so I thought I'd share this with you. I tested another fitness band recently, wearing it on the same arm as the Fitbit. The other band recorded a lot more steps than the Fitbit. I've \"manually\" counted steps while walking around different areas around my house and compared them to the Fitbit and found them to be exactly the same. But I never did it for more than about 100 steps. Now I was curious because the readings on the two bands were so different. So I went for a walk and counted out 1,000 steps as I took them, counting in my head. (Mumbling under my breath, actually.) Before I started, I noted the starting number of steps on my iPhone for both bands using the apps for each. At the end, I checked the number of steps for both bands. The Fitbit recorded 1004 steps. The other band recorded 1,217.  Only 4 extra steps on the Fitbit is pretty impressive and is close enough for me.  I'm contacting the manufacturer of the other band to see why it's so far off.Several people didn't realize that you can adjust the stride for the Fitbit. Just log into the dashboard in your Fitbit app, click on the little gear thingy in the upper right hand corner and select \"Settings\". There's a field there for Stride Length and Running Stride Length. You can manually enter your personal stride length. If you leave these blank, the app will estimate the values based on your height and whether you are a man or woman. Click the \"Update Profile\" button to save your changes. Remember to sync to update your tracker with the new stride measurements. I didn't even realize I could do this until several months after I had my Fitbit. I guess it must have estimated correctly in my case because when I put it in manually I didn't notice a difference.Update 4/30/15 - Fitbit has an update that now allows you to track multiple Fitbit devices on your Fitbit app. I haven't tried this, but from what I understand this will allow you to go back and forth between other models and once registered it will recognize them automatically. It's tempting to try the Fitbit Charge or the Surge that can measure heart rate or pulse or have caller ID. They're bulkier than I would like to wear on an all-the-time basis, but would be nice for workouts. And new technology is always fun. The Flex is still my first love and I like the switchable bands, but I'll look at the new models now that it isn't an either/or decision. Here are their instructions for adding another Fitbit:Update your Fitbit app (if you haven\u2019t already)\u2018Set Up a New Fitbit Device\u2019 from the Account tab in the Fitbit mobile app or Fitbit ConnectFinish the setup instructions, and start swapping \u2013 we\u2019ll take care of the rest!Update 5/7/15 - Has everyone seen the new Fitbit commercial?  I usually fast forward through TV commercials on the DVR, but this one I recorded and kept until I could find it on youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qVi_nF6y8  This makes me smile every time I watch it.Update 1/24/16 - When I purchased my Flex a little over 2 years ago it was advertised as being \"Water resistant to 10 meters or 33 feet\" which is 1 ATM. Their website now states: \"Flex has been tested up to 1 ATM meaning it is sweat, rain and splash proof. However, the device is not swim proof. We also recommend taking Flex off before showering because, as with any wearable device, it\u2019s best for your skin if the band stays dry and clean.\" The definition of 1 ATM, as I understand it is that it indicates that under static (nonmoving) conditions at 10 meters below the surface of the water the pressure of the water will not breach the seals on the device. But I can't take it into the shower? Perhaps even more confusing is the Fitbit Surge is rated at 5 ATM (50 meters) and has the same warning about not being swim proof and not to be worn in the shower. Are they just trying to ensure that users don't abuse the tracker?That said, I always shower with mine, I never dry it off afterward except the top when I'm drying my arms. I don't swim often but when I do, I leave it on. If I were going to spend a lot of time swimming on a regular basis I might take it off since it doesn't track swimming anyway. But for splashing around in a pool occasionally, I don't worry about it.My skin is somewhat sensitive to watch bands and I'm allergic to some metals and other materials. I couldn't be much LESS careful about the Fitbit and have never had a problem with the band and my skin. The underside is often damp from getting wet in the shower even half an hour later and it hasn't bothered my wrist. Being able to wear this 24/7 was a major selling point for me and it has worked just fine since January 2014.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ3OLAXHVN61P?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 4771, "review_title": "I purchased three of these"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2016-02-16", "review_body": "Oh yes, this device will cause a special kind of madness in you and your loved ones. More on that later, some of the  basics first.The Fitbit Flex is very easy to set up. The app will walk you through syncing to your phone, setting up goals and connecting to friends. Once set up you can log steps counted (shocking for a pedometer, right), calorie burn from other exercise, food intake, water intake and sleep. It is comfortable to wear, the battery life is decent and frankly being able to work towards fitness targets is a great motivator so it keeps you accountable.Where does the madness lie, I hear you ask. Challenges.The in app challenges will turn normally quite sane friends and family members into step obsessed lunatics. They work by allowing you to invite your Fitbit friends to see who can get the most steps in a day, work week or weekend. During the challenge time you get updates on how you are doing verses the step totals of everyone else in the challenge. If your work buddy powers past you, you'll get a notification through the app. Should you are your sister in law be neck and neck you'll both get a message letting you know. If you are even a little bit competitive this can lead to mayhem.Let's just say my wife and I are two people who don't like losing, especially to each other. I have found Mrs B. walking in tight circles in the kitchen while cooking, just to up that step count a little higher. I have been known to slip out of the house to get a quick walk around the block in, in an effort to make sure that she doesn't catch me. We've had reports of other family members watching TV while walking in place just to make sure they don't fall behind on a challenge.Don't get me wrong, the challenges are a lot of fun and really help you get more steps in which is great for your physical health. It's just neighbors who have seen me aimlessly walking around our back yard while muttering about step counts have started avoiding me in the street.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H466UIF6QN4F?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 28, "review_title": "Let the madness begin"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2013-05-17", "review_body": "Several asked my opinion of the Flex after I had compared UP to ONE last fall. I'm more pleased with Flex than expected.  This review will be specifically for those comparing the Jawbone UP to the Fitbit Flex. For those interested in my review of the One and Jawbone UP it is located here:\u00a0UP by Jawbone - Large Wristband - Retail Packaging - Onyx:---------------------UPDATE: I uploaded several head-to-head app screenshots.UPDATE: I've found that I am storing quite a bit of water in the Flex band pouch where the module goes. Even though they say it's shower safe, I'm pretty sure some funky stuff is going to be growing in there in a matter of time... But the band is replaceable!---------------------My journey with personal monitoring devices/pedometers started a LONG time ago: Before Fitbit even existed, with a device called the SportBrain. It was a traditional belt clip style so old that it plugged into a base that used a dial in phone modem to upload the usage data to a server. It was old. But my interest in devices that can help monitor and tell me about my activity started then, and we seem to be now in a golden age of personal data monitoring devices. Fitbit Flex, Jawbone UP, all of the Fitbit clip devices and so many more...Hardware itselfThe biggest drawbacks I found on the Jawbone UP were that it had no visual feedback about your daily achievement toward your goal and the fact that it had no visual battery indicator. It wasn't a problem for me personally, but for those who are hardcore driven on a daily basis to compare and achieve this could be a drawback for you. The next drawback about the Jawbone UP is that it does not wirelessly sync.  You have to plug it into the headset jack of your phone to sync. If you are someone who wants data and feedback all day long, this would be a drawback.The Fitbit Flex does have visual feedback in the form of small white lights: They blink as you're charging, they have a special blink if you put it into sleep mode and provide 95% more feedback than Jawbone up. Jawbone UP does have status lights in it and they are used, but they could do a lot more with the lights they already have if they chose to.If you can throw a snap bracelet on, you can easily put on the UP. I did find myself fumbling a bit with the clip mechanism of the Flex like I do when I have to button my own shirt cuffs. After it was clipped though, it feels secure and I am not one to put on and remove devices like this. I want to set it and forget it.Fit &amp; FeelThe Fitbit Flex feels very comfortable on the wrist. The pictures don't do it justice. For me personally this is the one defining factor that really makes the Flex shine for me compared to the Jawbone UP. It feels super light weight, doesn't grab, and doesn't look nearly as big/thick as the pictures make it look.The UP uses tension to stay on, while the Flex uses a clasp. The UP may have a better sense of solid attachment that wouldn't come off no matter how hard you fling your arm, but the inverse of that is the Flex: It doesn't have to monkey-grip your arm to be there and stay. You can have it fit a bit more loosely than UP and be comfortable.When typing on at a keyboard, I prefer the feel of the Flex.  The rubber is flat and thin so it adds very little against the edge of a keyboard. The UP doesn't have the big square bump on the top, but it does have a bracelet shape/size all the way around, so it can prove a bit more of an annoyance up against a keyboard.The Flex does have replaceable bracelets and colors, which means the device is more convertible and flexible going forward. That being said, it is less visually appealing to me compared to the UP. The UP can be a part of jewelry and most people would never notice. The Flex does have a strange-ish future nerd look to it. I don't mind that, but some may.I wear both in the shower with no issues. I've done a lot of swimming pool roughhousing with the UP with no issues, but haven't tried with the FLEX. A commenter tells me that it is swimming approved, though the data provided might not be that useful.Battery Life &amp; ChargingBoth the Flex and the UP charge in very similar almost identical USB adapters. They're meant to be charged on a computer and in my experience shouldn't be charged off of a phone USB wall charger. They both charged in similar amounts of time, and the Flex did last about 4 days on a charge.  The UP can last as much as 10 days on a new battery, but I found that it has declined some since November.  On this case, I say that both do about what they suggest. The UP fits snugly in the charger, while the Flex doesn't feel nearly as secure in its charger but I haven't had any issues with it falling out.Syncing:The Jawbone UP sync's via the headphone jack of the phone. It doesn't do Bluetooth, can't be plugged into a PC, so you're pretty much set on a smart phone or table to sync it. It's simple, doesn't consume battery to sync wirelessly, and works reliably. You have to watch because not all phones are supported.The Flex syncs wirelessly with Bluetooth 4.0 via the smartphone or via an adapter to a computer. For those without a smart phone or a locked down phone that work doesn't allow you to install apps, this could be a deal maker for you. It's not a constant sync but initiates as soon as you open the app on the smartphone. I haven't noticed any significant battery life loss. Not all phones are supported with Bluetooth 4.0-- most phones on the market don't yet have Bluetooth 4.0. You'll want to check Fitbit's website to see if your phone is supported. On the upside, the Flex does come with a Bluetooth adapter you can plug into a PC or Mac to sync wirelessly via the computer. It really adds extra work and decreases the usefulness of wireless sync, but it's do-able.Software:The software, to me, is the major differentiating factor between the two devices.  The hardware looks entirely different, and there are some small differences in what the hardware can do, but the delivery through the app is what makes them clearly meant for different targets.The Jawbone UP software is beautiful. After you've sync'd enough it starts giving you feedback and encouragement through statistics. It will tell you \"you were in the top 15% of UPpers this week\" or \"getting 8 hours of sleep per night it shown to improve....\" if your sleep is coming up short. It does have the option to add in food consumption, performs a variety of tasks such as calibrating it's readings with actual distance walked, and has a really interesting \"lifeline\" feature that trends your activity &amp; sleep over a period of hours, days, weeks and you can create a report on the fly comparing, for example, sleeping and calorie intake, to see if you consume more calories on days that you didn't have adequate sleep. It shows trends on daily/weekly and true to the marketing is a more \"holistic\" view of you and your life/activity. I guess we have reached my thesis for the comparison: Jawbone UP is about the holistic view of your life, while the Fitbit Flex is more finely focused on activity, seeing feedback for that activity in a quick frequent way and focusing on providing you that core data quickly and simply.The Fitbit software is the same software in use for all current Fibit devices. As soon as you launch it, a sync begins and your latest data will be presented. While the UP presents more current data on the \"HOME\" page, Fitbit has other tabs where you can explore the data they present. UPDATE: I discovered that the Fitbit software does do single activity trending if you turn the phone sideways: Hours/days/weeks, etc. It doesn't compare it to another statistic, but better than nothing.Both devices sync your data to a website.  The Flex presents a more insightful view of your data on the website, while UP presents an equal amount of that data on the mobile app.  Both support third party apps if you are really intense about a specific subject ( like food/calories with extensive catalogues, MyFitnessPal, etc.)A few features that the Flex has that the UP does not:-Lighted feedback on the band-more flexible fit, colors that can be changed after purchase-Thinner band around places you may bump against desks, etc.-wireless syncing (Jawbone needs to get on this train)-quick access in the app to 'water consumed'Fitbit Flex: Less expensive, simple quick device for activity &amp; sleep tracking and wireless syncing from a company that is widely known for pedometers.A few features that UP has that Flex does not:-insight engine to look at your data and provide you feedback-longer maximum battery life-inactivity alarm. Fitbit could easily issue this in an update. I love this feature on the UP-bar code scanner in the food app to scan premade food for nutrition contents-power nap which will auto wake you between 25-45 minutes by modeling after your normal short sleep cycleJawbone UP: Technology that could pass for fashion. A fantastic app with a holistic view on your life, sleep and wellness.Both devices are good devices and had no fatal flaws. Both devices offer communities and ability to add friends to provide encouragement and interaction.  If I had to give an elevator speech about the difference between the two:1. A few tech differences: Flex has wireless sync and quick feedback throughout the day. Flex is thick on top, and thin around. UP is more consistent without a clasp.2.  UP has a very useful insight engine and is more of a \"holistic\" view. Less rewarding for someone who wants instant feedback. It's all about your time horizon: If you want to look at days and weeks of data, receive valuable feedback about your activity and sleep patterns and wellness the UP will probably please you most. If you are someone who wants hourly motivation and ability to sync frequently then the Flex is probably the right device for you.I hope this comparison has been helpful. If you have any specific questions I will be happy to answer or investigate &amp; answer. My personal lean is toward the UP simply because I am using it to observe my sleep and activity from a bigger picture view. Sometimes I may go a day or few before I sync. If I were in a mode for physical fitness or weight loss, I may probably prefer the Flex. It all depends on your objective. There really isn't a fight between these devices-- they're both good and are focused towards different crowds.UPDATE: I found an interesting quirk with Flex: I was shopping at a store today and the shopping cart had a wheel that was a little bumpy.  During my shopping I felt a vibration from Flex and thought maybe I had made a part of my daily goal. Then: BZZ, BZZ, BZZ! Turns out that the bumping of the cart in a rhythmic way confused the Flex into thinking I tapped it.  It kept going in and out of sleep mode. Whoops.  I can't wait until I see today's data....", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CVXEEYIAIR0W?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 4097, "review_title": "Jawbone UP vs Fitbit Flex -- Fight!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2013-04-16", "review_body": "The Flex is fairly good - IF you understand its limitations. And it has a lot of them. This is a 1.0 version, the first wrist-based tracker Fitbit has produced. There are good reasons why there are so many negative reviews of the Flex. I strongly suggest that you wait for the technology to be refined by Fitbit (and others) before spending $100 or more on this.I also suggest that you tune out the 5-star \"this is AWESOME!\" reviewers. I've had the Flex for 6 months now (acquired at CES 2013, long before retail availability) and initially I too was impressed by the technology. However, with long-term use, I think its inaccuracies make it nothing more than a pedometer with sleep analysis added in (and the usefulness of the latter is dubious as well). The IDEA of it all is excellent: to track your activities and see your progress over time via the great software that Fitbit has developed. However, all of this is predicated on the device accurately tracking your movements. If it fails in that aspect - and unfortunately it does, to a moderate degree - then all of the data and impressive charts and graphs are rather useless. The \"awesome!\" reviewers don't realize this (yet) and just assume what they're seeing is real; it isn't.The underlying technological problem, as I see it, is in the placement of the tracker. Up until now, Fitbit trackers were to be placed on the torso. Now, it must be placed on the wrist (yes, the tracker itself can be taken out of the wristband and put into your pocket but all of Fitbit's calibrations and algorithms are designed for that wrist placement and you are making the problem worse by not having it on your wrist). So, if your wrist movement is ANYTHING other than the usual movement of either running or walking, your step count/mileage is going to be off - often way, way off.Fitbit markets the Flex as an \"activity monitor\", implying that it is capable of keeping stats on your physical activities. Well, because of the wrist location issue and the basic design structure of using two stride lengths for all calculations (your walking and running stride lengths), pretty much any activity that is NOT walking or running cannot be accurately monitored: the accelerometer senses whether you are walking or running and multiplies the appropriate stride length by the number of steps sensed (and arrives at a mileage distance). Any activity outside of that limited ability of the Flex, your stats are innacurate. This includes stair-climbing, hiking, tennis, golf, biking, working out, and pretty much every other \"activity\" that is not walking or running. The Flex is not really an \"activity monitor\"; it's an expensive pedometer (albeit one with \"sleep analysis\", which is actually only a record of how much wrist movement you had during the night: i.e., 2 hours of no movement = deep sleep, an hour of sporadic movement = restless sleep).There are, however, aspects of the Flex that are quite good: it does accurately keep track of your walking and running, it does keep track of your sleeping patterns, and it also wakes you with a silent vibration on your wrist at the time you set to get up in the morning. And once out of bed and into the shower, there's no need to take the Flex off: it's almost completely waterproof (pressurized water being the exception). But the best, perhaps life-enhancing aspect of the Flex is its ability to keep you focused on your exercise goals (which is the main reason why, overall, I like the device and its software - to a point): if you DO consider it only a pedometer with cool software, which is what I consider it to be, you will not be disappointed (though the price may not seem worth it to others).First, there's the 'onboard' function to keep you aware of your progress towards your daily goals (total distance traveled, number of steps taken, or calories burned): each light on the row of 5 small LED lights on the band represents 20% of your goal and a quick glance and a tap on the band will tell you how you're doing. Secondly, for the actual stats of your progress (or reviewing your daily, weekly or longer stats), you can view them in real time on your phone via the Fitbit App for iPhone and Android, or on your tablet or PC/Mac with the Fitbit 'Dashboard'. This is where you set your daily and longer-term goals, view not only your stats but see them represented in charts and graphs, and log other information such as weight, weight changes, and food consumed. You can go further, but personally I would feel a bit silly setting goals where I would receive 'badges' for reaching them. But that's just me. Overall though, the software is very good and keeps you aware - along with the band's LEDs - of whether or not you are staying on track of exercise goals. But, again, just keep in mind that the wrist placement of the device gives the Flex an inherent flaw as to the accuracy of all this data - UNLESS you are using it only to monitor and analyze walking and running stats, as I do.If you're like me and the term \"highly-motivated\" (or \"disciplined\") and your name rarely appear in the same sentence, the Flex is a great help in that regard: it makes you keenly aware of whether you're succeeding or failing in your exercise regimen, which I find to be a great help in discipline and motivation. The Flex is a good motivator because you do not want to have today's exercise stats look inferior to yesterday's - or this week's less than last week's - or this month's less than last month's: you can graphically SEE all this on a color graph, your success or failure staring you right in the face. And who wants to stare at his or her failure or laziness? We want to see improvement, to see success. And, for me, this is why the Flex is a valuable tool: an ever-present motivator. I personally use it for running and I find that I really push myself to prevent the present week's stats (total mileage, etc.) from failing to outdo last week's. Seeing the charts and color graphs of several months of steady progress, there's a real feeling of accomplishment and a strong motivation to continue. It is this visual presentation of your exercise efforts that sets the Flex (and other Fitbit models) apart, in my opinion.Is the Flex a miracle device that will accurately detail your every movement, every calorie burned, throughout your day? No, it's an accelerometer/pedometer based on your stride lengths and your wrist movement; there are many activities where it is impossible for such a device to determine steps, etc. Fitbit's marketing of the device was overblown, calling the Flex an \"activity monitor/tracker\", implying - to many - that all activities could be measured for steps/mileage/calories, which is not the case. Further, Fitbit should not be marketing it as a calorie monitor because an accelerometer alone (which is what the Flex is) cannot possibly count calories burned with any real accuracy.So, overall, I would give the Flex 2 stars, based on the way it's marketed to the general public. It does fail to live up to many buyers' expectations (read the many 1- and 2-star raging reviews). The technology required to do what Fitbit infers the Flex can do - tracking and monitoring most physical activities - is probably a few years away. Someday there may be a Flex with integrated GPS, heart-rate monitor and an accurate altimeter: THEN we can expect steps/mileage/calories counts to be done for many more activities. For now, this Flex (\"Flex 1.0\") is basically a pedometer (with a few other features) and its accuracy is limited to a narrow range of activity. My personal needs happen to fall into that narrow range: I use it only for running and walking exercise and in analyzing, graphically, my fitness history and progress via the Dashboard, and it's a great motivational tool. For my personal needs, I'd probably have to give it 3 stars (but this would be misleading to the average Amazon buyer). Unless your personal needs are as narrow as mine, I would hold off on buying the Flex until improvements are made. You can duplicate this model's limited abilities with a decent pedometer and freeware/shareware to manually input and analyze the stats.----------------------------------------------------------------UPDATEThere have been so many good questions about aspects of the Flex that I didn't cover originally that it's probably best that I expand the review:LOCATION OF TRACKER: Early questions asked about whether or not you can wear the tracker outside of the band or with the band around your ankle, etc. (earlier Fitbits could be worn anywhere on the torso). It is only accurate on your wrist (or, rather, it is most accurate on your wrist, its overall accuracy pretty questionable).ACCURACY OVERALL: For usual activities like walking and running, if you see inaccuracies in mileage or number of steps, probably your stride measurements are not like the average person for your height (which is what Fitbit uses for default strides, your height entered when you set up your account). In your account settings, you can change 'Stride Length' and 'Running Stride Length' in order to calibrate the accuracy. Ignore the reviewer who states that you can't calibrate the Flex: you can; all the tracker is doing is counting steps (and multiplying those steps for mileage amounts); since you can adjust your stride lengths, you can calibrate the Flex to your exact needs. The device has a walking step (stride) and a running step and counts them (and converts your steps to mileage). The only way to have accurate mileage is for the Flex to KNOW your two stride distances and to have the wrist tracker sense whether you're walking or running; if you mess with those dynamics (irregular steps, irregular wrist movement), you mess with accuracy, simple as that.There is an additional tweak to minimize wrist movement inaccuracies: you CAN go into your dashboard settings and change the location of the wristband from 'dominate hand' to 'non-dominate', but I've found that this to be of little use: the Flex is only reliable when walking and running AND having normal wrist activity while doing so. Instances where one wrist is more active than the other are not likely to be in walking and running activities.WATERPROOF: It is not entirely waterproof. You can wear it in the shower or along the surface of a pool. However, it's not rated to withstand water at depth - water where there's pressure.STAIRS: Unlike its predecessors like the One, the Flex does not have an altimeter and therefore cannot count stairs climbed. From what I read, Fitbit did away with it because it was inherently inaccurate.BANDS: The Flex comes with both a small and a large band. The large band goes from about 6 1/4\" to 8 1/4\" and the small, 5 1/2\" to almost 7\" and both are fully adjustable between those lengths. Putting on the band is difficult the first week or so - the rubber is a bit stiff - but then it becomes looser and easier to put on.TREADMILLS: Your 'Running Stride Length' on a treadmill may be shorter than on the road (no forward momentum). See above about tweaking stride lengths.HEART RATE: No, there is no heart rate monitor.CALORIE COUNTS: The Flex really should NOT be marketed as a calorie-burning monitor. No device without a heart-rate monitor can accurately determine calorie burning. But when using the Flex to simply analyze a run or a long walk, it can 'ballpark' calories burned fairly well; expecting it to tell you how many calories you burned in the past 24 hours - not so much.SUBSCRIPTION: For your normal account there is no additional charge for anything but for a 'Premium Account', which gives additional analysis and tips (such as a 'Fitbit Trainer' 12-week plan, more data analysis, a 'peer ranking', etc.), it is $49.95 per year. The Premium doesn't really seem worth it, to me, but then again it's only $4 a month or so for someone who wants to get more from the Flex.SLEEP MODE: There are two options for sleep mode. One is automatic and does not require you to \"tell\" the Flex that you are going to sleep, like the Up and and other competing models; however, you do need to log your sleep hours on your dashboard; at the next sync your sleep data will be visible. Alternatively you can fast tap the band when going to bed and do the same when you wake up. Personally, I prefer the dashboard method as I would probably forget quite often to tap the band. The Flex determines amounts of restful vs. wakeful/restless sleep simply by wrist movement (i.e., no movement for 2 hours = restful sleep). The novelty of being able to analyze your sleep patterns soon wears off, at least in my case; the usefulness of the data seems questionable.ANDROID COMPATIBILITY: You need Bluetooth 4 for real time syncing.CHARGING: It takes about 2 hours to fully charge using the dedicated USB cord. The battery lasts about a week.OVERALL OPINION: I did use the thing for months: it kept me motivated by being able to compare walking and running stats over time via the software interface. Otherwise, it was no better than a decent pedometer (and triple the cost). It fell apart after 3 months, like it seems to do quite commonly. Remember that this is the 1.0 version of the Flex, so enhanced capabilities - and better quality overall - may not be too far away. Perhaps the Flex 2.0 will be worth the list price if improvements are made but this 1.0 version is really not be worth it for most people. Read the many 1- and 2-star reviews as evidence of this. And, again, do not trust the mountain of 5-star reviews: if you look at them, 90% are 5 words or less ('Love my Fitbit!'), written by people who have no idea as to whether all the shiny color graphs and step counts are accurate or not. They are not, for reasons explained above.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31RH7W0AX7OJA?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 7742, "review_title": "Why does this now have over 4 THOUSAND negative reviews?"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-06-03", "review_body": "Are you kidding me?First two out of three of our Fitbits are bad,.

Tracking my steps and sleep were very helpful mainly because it connected straight to my iPhone. I do wish that I went for the one with the larger screen because it's more interactive and you don't need to go to the iPhone app.  In regards to tracking steps I noticed that on the days I went walking with my friends my steps were more than if I walked alone, even if I walked a shorter distance with my friends than alone. I talk a lot with my hands so because the Fitbit tracks motion I ended up adding some steps because of my hand talking.  I do reccomend this for someone who is not trying to track every single step they take but for someone who is beginning their fitness journey and wants to set general goals each day to reach.  Packaging wise everything was in prime condition when it arrived and it was very easy to set up and connect to my phone.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R387ZMJOBCKNMI?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Great for fitness beginners"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2016-02-17", "review_body": "This thing is a holy pain in the rear to get on and it's waaaay too sensitive.

It may seem strange, but I know he hears me and my friends talking about Fitbits all the time, and he gets in on the conversations about our challenges.  Anyway, we bought him one, and he loves it!  We have it synced to my husband's phone, and he has joined challenges with me.  Because he gets to go out for recess and because I am a slacker, he usually beats me. :)For those of you who do not know what a Fitbit is, let me explain it to you.  A Fitbit is a tool to help people measure how much exercise they are getting.  This one is worn like a bracelet, and so long as it is charged, it keeps track of how many steps you take in one day. For a person who doesn't work out regularly, the goal is to take 10,000 steps in one day. However, I changed my goal to 15,000 steps each day because it forced me to get some extra steps in on a daily basis. Anyway, so the Fitbit helps you keep track of how many steps you take.The steps taken is then transferred into two different calculations:  miles walked and calories burned.  I have used an app to measure my running distance in comparison with the Fitibit, and I find that it is usually within .2 miles of what the app says. The jury is still out on calories burned, however.  As with any fitness device, it is hard to know if they are estimating correctly.  When I wear my heart rate monitor, I find that both my Fitbit and my son's Fitbit overcalculate how many calories burned.  The same goes for most Fitness apps though, so perhaps it is my heart rate monitor?  Either way, if you are a person who is tracking your calories in versus calories out, I would say to be cautious about taking the calories burned as a accurate measure, just in case.If you are looking for a gift for just about anyone, this would be a great idea! Like I said, my son is 8 years old and loves his. He requested it, so I guess it's not a huge surprise.  This would also be a great gift for someone who is looking to lose weight and get fit (swimsuit season right around the corner, right?), or for a person who is just religious about exercise and wants another way to keep track of activity.  It comes in different colors too if you don't like the orange. :)The Fitbit Flex also has a sleep monitor, which tells you how well you slept and how long you slept.  My son doesn't wear his to bed, but I've worn mine to bed before.  Honestly, I already know how well I sleep and don't sleep, so I didn't learn a lot of information by wearing it to bed.  It might be interesting for some people though. Likewise, it has an alarm that you can set, but neither my son nor I use the alarm either.Anyway, it's a pretty cool little gadget.

Easy to set up and use. During week 2 it failed to sync twice. I followed the instructions to reset -- uninstalled from phone and computer, put back on charger until fully charged, then re-installed. It worked fine both times. On a Saturday night in the 3rd week it again failed to sync and I didn't realize it until I got up Sunday morning. It had registered nothing since the evening before. Again, I reset as above. This time it took four times over about 2 hrs until it finally began working. I complained on the Fitbit site and was told to do the same things I'd already done, that the site might be down, and a couple other useless tips.

GPS activity totally inaccurate. Walked known 1.6 mi. route and GPS logged me at 3.5 mi. During regular step counting, the Flex often had me burning 1300-1400 cals for a 2.5 mi. casual walk. My Galaxy S5 phone with S-health feature, and my pedometer are consistent with about 300-350 cals.I've gone back to my $20, 5-year-old Omron pedometer.

If you are pushing a cart around a supermarket, or Costco, or some such, your steps will not be reliably recorded.  One time I spent an hour shopping in Costco.  Fitbit recorded 12 steps!  Conversely, if you scratch a mosquito bite, or scratch your back, Fitbit will record a bunch of steps.Fitbit tracks your sleep, as well as your steps.  While subject to the occasional bizarre result, the sleep tracker is pretty impressive.The big difference between Fitbit and other pedometers is the social media aspect.  You can hook up with friends and family and let them see your results, and see theirs.  Fitbit affirmatively encourages competition.  To the extent that improves health, or is fun, that is great.

They could tell on their end that the recharging piece was bad and offered to replace it (wonder how they knew that?), but I just want my money back, or at least a partial refund. They stand by their 45 day only refund policy like a rock and did not budge.  I was calm and factual with my presentation of the amount of time I had invested and the problems I was not willing to entertain it any longer.

It is difficult to remove steps that erroneous, i.e. I put it on a table with a fan one night at bedtime and it logged 25,000 steps from the vibration. I found a \"workaround\" to delete this by reporting I was driving during those hours, but it happened again and the same process do not work at all... app is VERY FLUKY... too expensive for these types of time consuming frustrations.

I debated for a long time if I wanted to purchase one of these for myself and I received one for Mother's Day and am now giving them to my mom and mother-in-law for Christmas! There are a number of Fitbits on the market and I liked the Fitbit Flex because it is a simple pedometer that I can wear on my wrist and it is a fairly reasonable price for all of the cool features it has. Even after six months, I haven't been able to play with all of the features that it has but I've definitely gotten my use out of it and really like it.One of my favorite features of the Fitbit is how well it counts your steps and tells you the intensity of your walking/workout. It is pretty sensitive and senses every time your foot hits the ground, even if you are just walking around the house or at the grocery store. I have been amazed at the number of steps that I take throughout the day and I don't even realize it! This feature has definitely encouraged me to walk even more and now it's natural for me to want to get up and move around. There are lights on the outside of the band that tell you approximately how many steps you've taken so far that day which show when you tap the wristband twice (normally there aren't any lights showing until you tap it to check the steps or activate the sleep feature). There is one light for every 2000 steps so when you've just woken up and walked around the house a bit, it will show one light. It will show two lights for steps between 2000 and 3999 steps, three lights for 4000 to 5999 steps, etc. You can then check your Fitbit Dashboard (the program Fitbit uses) on your computer or smartphone to see the exact number of steps, the intensity of the workout, and the number of steps taken between each time period.I also really like the sleep feature. To activate this, you tap the wristband several times until the first and last lights appear on the band. Then you know it is in sleep mode. When you wake up in the morning, you tap in a number of times again until all of the lights flash. If you then go to your computer or phone, it will tell you how many hours you have slept that night and the number of times you were awakened. It also tells you how long it takes you to fall asleep. There is a silent alarm feature you can use so you don't wake anyone else up but I haven't used that yet. When I first got the Fitbit, I wasn't sure if I would be able to sleep with it on my wrist since I wasn't used to it but it hasn't been a problem at all and now I hardly notice I'm wearing it.There are a number of other features the Fitbit Dashboard can do such as calories burned, number of ounces of water drank, food intake and weight (the last three you have to log). You can invite friends to join you via email or Facebook and encourage each other to increase your workouts and goals. The program will also email you when your battery is low so you will need to use an email address that you check frequently. I have found I need to charge my Fitbit weekly and I try to charge it while I am sleeping so I can track my steps during the day instead of tracking my sleep. You charge it via a USB port so I just leave the Fitbit's charger plugged into my laptop so I can easily pop in the Fitbit to charge. The monitor itself is inside the wristband and you just pull off the wristband and pull out the device, which is then very easy to do since the wristband is made of a flexible, rubber-like material. Once it is done charging, you put in back in and you are good to go! The monitor stays securely in the wristband and the opening to get it out is against your wrist.The Fitbit Flex also comes in a variety of colors and is very stylish looking. It looks a lot like a bracelet and you can even purchase replacement bands in different colors if you want to switch up the color. I have the pink color and love it and purchased the black for my mom and mother-in-law. Each Fitbit comes with two adjustable wristbands, one small and one large so they should fit most people's wrists. I use the small wristband and just tried the large one on my husband's wrist. He has a big build and the large fit him with a little room to spare!The only reason I gave the Fitbit Flex four stars instead of five is because the device is supposed to sync automatically when it's within 20 feet of the Bluetooth dongle and it doesn't always do that even when I am sitting a foot away from it. You can manually force it to sync or it will just eventually sync and it hasn't been a huge problem for me.Overall, I think the Fitbit Flex is a great pedometer for anyone who wants to be more conscious of their activity throughout the day. Even if you just want to see how many steps you walk while at work, running errands or just throughout a normal day, this is a nice device for that. I feel it has encouraged me to walk even more and now that I am aware of what type of activity I do on a daily basis, I can figure out ways to improve it. There are a number of Fitbits out there from the basic Zip to the high-performance Surge. Depending on the amount of money you want to spend and the features you want to get out of the Fitbit, the Flex may be a good option for anyone who wants a basic pedometer that you can wear on your wrist. I haven't even explored all of the features of the Flex yet and I am very happy with the one I have and know my families will be happy with theirs as well! I think the price of the Fitbit Flex is very reasonable for the amount of features it has and I highly recommend this product!", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6ARQX7HTMC9R?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Great Device for Anyone Who Wants to Be More Active!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-05-27", "review_body": "I've had my Fitbit for just over a year and I'm not too happy about it.

I had the shine for about a year.  I liked the shine but here are my pros and cons of each, what \"I\" am looking for an activity tracker (not too much!) and what I'm hoping to get from the third tracker (jawbone)  I am sure these trackers do more that I use them for. But my main use I'm looking for is 1. steps; 2. calorie counter; 3. physical activity (other than steps); 2. sleep tracking; 3. silent alarm;SHINE -PROs - It has the battery, so I didn't have hook up the tracker every 5-10 days.  I like the battery since it's one less thing I have to charge up..  I also like the sleep tracker with the shine, it seemed very accurate.  The steps were also very accurate and when I was engaged in activity (I was taking tennis lessons at the time), I had put \"tennis\" as my special activity so that when I hit it 3 times the tracker tracked my tennis.CONS - The Shine stopped synching  I thought it was the battery and so I bought several new batteries.  Then I turned off / on the application.  Finally I emailed the company (there was no phone number) and they told me to do what I had already done.  The shine still wasn't synching so I decided to get the fitbit.FITBITPROS - Fitbit is a sleeker design, which I liked.  And I really liked the silent alarm.  I didn't realize I needed it until I didn't have it.CONS - I don't like the fact that I have to take it off and on again (since the rechargable part of the tracker is in the strap that needs to be removed.  The shine spoiled me to that)  I also didn't like that you removed the chargeable part from the tracker bracelet.  I misplaced the bracelet several times and -- while that's my issue and I eventually found it -- It's one more \"removeable\" piece.Another con was the sleeper tracker.  I want to track the sleep as much as this tracks the steps.  Bur with the fitbit, you need to \"place it\" into sleep mode.  So some days i would remember (but not remember to take it out) and have about 16 hours of sleep.  Then some days I wouldn't remember to put the fitbit in sleep mode at all and I would still have 3 1/2 hours.Jawbone - UP2 - I just got this delivered and set up todayPROS - Like the fitbit, this is a really sleek design that I enjoy.  I appreciate the fact the there is no \"tracker\" to remove like on the fitbit, so there is one less think for me to lose.And it seems to have a slightly more charged life than the fitbit.  Another pro (although I haven't tried it yet), is the sleep tracker doesn't need anything to \"begin\" tracking the sleep.  The UP2 also has the silent alarm which is great.CONS - I still prefer the Shine's' battery (when it works) so that it lasts longer than re-charging 7-10 daysI haven't done much other work with the jawbone yet, but I thought I would go ahead and add this as part of the review here in case people need to compare.One thing I will say is that the trackers all reinforced my behavior.  I was shopping when I wasn't using a tracker and was waiting for the jawbone and doing lots of shopping.  I would get home and think \"I need to see how many steps that was!\"  It's great for reinforcing behaviour and also would help more if you could get your friends on the same tracker system.

I don't share her sentiment. It's a glorified pedometer and not much more than that. The pedometer can't be used alone. You have to create an account and use the web-based interface or the app they tote for Android/iOS. If you're looking for instructions you won't find them in the box. They direct you to their website for setup instead. There's not a lot of documentation on normal operation. I'm still waiting to see what happens when the battery dies.The device uses a dongle to sync with the PC (computer) which is fine if you have constant access to a computer to update your progress. If, however, you expect to sync throughout the day with your phone like my wife intended to do, you will most likely run into problems unless you're sporting the latest and greatest Samsung, iPhone, iPad, Sony, or HTC. The pedometer uses Bluetooth v4.0 Smart (also called Low Energy) and is not backwards compatible with any other version of Bluetooth. This is not clearly stated anywhere on their site or with their retailers. My wife wanted this so she could compete with her coworkers on various challenges (out-stepping) but since she can't check progress or accept challenges until she gets home the pedometer is relatively useless. If we had known this upfront we would have saved our $99 for something useful.I don't keep up with the advancement of Bluetooth technology. I've sent files, connected to speakers/headsets, and used Bluetooth controllers. Beyond that, I couldn't tell you the difference between 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, or 4.0 Smart. I only know that it's required for this device because of all the contact I've had with customer service. Also, if you have Bluetooth 4.0 it doesn't guarantee that your device is compatible. It has to be Smart or Low Energy. I was told this by FitBit support and they recommended that I buy one of the phones/devices on their compatible devices list.

Fitbit ZIP number 1 arrived in spring 2013 and was lost within 4 months. My second ZIP was lost within 6 months.I received my original Flex in spring 2014 as part of a company fitness effort. Amusingly, ZIP number 2 fell off my clothing within 2 days of the Flex arriving.And, my husband has a Charge, so the Charge comparisons below are based on his usage.Comparison of the three:Battery time: The ZIP has a replaceable battery which needs to be replaced once or twice a year.The Flex has to be charged roughly every 5 days.  The Charge may have also taken longer but not by much - a few days at most.Sleep tracking: If the ZIP has any way to track sleep, I'm not aware of it (but you can manually do so from the app). I believe the Charge works similarly to the Flex.Alarm capabilies: The Flexc and Charge both have the ability to buzz at preset times. The ZIP, not being designed for wrist wear, does not.Lose-ability: While I'm quite certain you can manage to lose the Flex (even if it's in the wristband), it's much harder since you can simply leave it in the wristband and wear it 24/7 (except when charging). Similarly for the Charge.Customization: The ZIP can be put in a different color third-party wristband. The Flex has numerous alternative bracelets - different colors, some handmade, some metallic. The Charge and its bracelet are a single unit, there is no way to switch to a new bracelet when the old one wears out - as it will, in a year or two at best.Altitude tracking (i.e. stairs): Charge has this, ZIP and Flex do not. It's a feature that would be nice to have - helps track extra calories burned when climbing stairs versus walking on flat ground - but I don't miss it.Accuracy: Stepwise, it seems reasonable the few times I've tried manually counting steps. Distance-wise: seems reasonably accurate when I've walked a known distance (about a mile). Calories burned: There are articles out there that discuss accuracy of such trackers; I can't judge one way or the other. It's probably close enough unless you need to be EXTREMELY strict about in versus out.Durablity: The ZIP had no time to break or wear out. The Charge's tracker works fine but the bracelet is falling apart. The Flex has now been replaced, twice - it seems like it's designed to fail after a year. The first one lasted 15 months before refusing to sync. Despite trying everything (reset, cleaning contacts with rubbing alcohol, it simply would not connect to my phone or my computer. In FitBit's favor, they replaced it even though the warranty had long since expired.  The second Flex worked for about 14-15 months before doing the same thing. Both times, it charged, and appeared to track just fine, there was simply no way to get the data into the cloud. I've just replaced it with my third Flex - we'll see how long that lastsWater-resistant: ZIP, yes. Wearing it in the shower would seem to be a nonissue unless you shower with your clothes on (or opt for a third-party wrist band). Flex, yes (can be worn while showering but not swimming). Charge, yes (though they do not recommend leaving it on in the shower). If I leave my Flex on while showering, I try to make a point of taking it off and out of the wristband for a few minutes afterward to let it dry thoroughly.Appearance: ZIP could basically be hidden by careful placement. Some people use  a third-party wristband with the ZIP which allows you to wear it on your wrist - where it looks like a brightly colored wristwatch. A bit larger than usual for a woman's watch but it works. The Flex has a fairly slim band and with replacements, could coordinate with your different outfits. The Charge has a much wider band and is much more obvious - I really disliked it, especially as I also wear a wristwatch on that hand. There are no alternate bands available for the Charge.Display: ZIP has an LCD display that shows steps, time etc. when you tap it. Not useful in the dark but very informative. The Charge has an LED display so you could use it as a wristwatch. The Flex has only a row of LED dots which give you hints as to how many steps, but nothing more than that.  You'll need a timekeeping device as well (wristwatch, your phone, a wall clock) to tell what time of day it is, and you'll need your phone app or computer browser to see exactly how many steps.Bottom line: I wish the Flex had a longer-lasting battery. My ideal choice would be a melding of the Flex and the Zip: a replaceable battery, worn on the wrist (the clip-on Zip is far too easy to lose), and with a silent alarm.  As there is no such hybrid available, I'm sticking with the Flex for now. If the Zip had the silent alarm, I'd have gone with that + a wristband.The Flex definitely beats the others in terms of customizability, with the wide variety of wristbands both from Fitbit and third parties.Why I only gave it three stars: The short-ish battery life (I frequently forget to charge it, or forget to put it back on after it's charged), and the fact that I've had two in a row die after just over a year.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FDDWXZKAX2RE?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Best combination of features but reliability is a concern."}], [{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-11-21", "review_body": "The Fitbit Flex is a wonderful way to track your walking and a great motivator for keeping active.

At this point in time both my husband and I have one and I've included my observations below.Pros:It's fairly accurate. I use it while synced to my iphone and I frequently take it out and watch my step count change as I take multiple steps. I've also tested it against running in place/ running up stairs and was pleasantly surprised when it came to its accuracy when compared to some other tracking software I've used in the past.It's easy to latch around your wrist, you can easily do it with your opposite hand and without help.You can order additional wrist bands in a variety of colors to fit your style.The fitbit program allows you to compare your progress to friends.

I've even purchased one for my 80 year old grandmother. (Side note, this has worked well from a monitoring stand point. She lives alone, and we're friends with fitbit. I can make sure that she's been actively out and about during the week without having to frequently call on her to check on her. She has her independence and motivation to keep moving, and I have a little piece of mind that she hasn't fallen)Cons:I find it slightly uncomfortable to sleep in. Full disclaimer, I absolutely loathe watches and things latched around my wrist. I've always been this way, so not everyone will agree with this point. I can tolerate this most of the time, but it tends to accumulate sweat at night and I find it a bit unbearable.If you own a rocking chair it becomes INCREDIBLY inaccurate. You can not rock with this tracker. It picks up the movement and skyrockets your step count. As I have a newborn, this was a bit of an annoyance for me. I have to remember to remove it while rocking and remember to put it back on when I get up. Unfortunately, I frequently forget.The bands break. I don't know if it's just my family, but we seem to go through an incredible amount of bands for this thing.Syncing is sometimes a pain. Multiple people in my family have also had this issue across separate computers/ states/ internet connections/ phones making me believe that it can't just be us.All in all I do like my fitbit.

Although the design is plain and rather cheap looking, it was a fairly decent way to increase my level of physical activity. I wore my Fitbit for nearly 18 months before it fell off my wrist and was lost. I quickly learned that the company is well aware of the fact that their clasp fails quite often and that many Fitbit Flex users have experienced a lost device (including several of my friends who have had similar experiences!). The company could so easily fix this problem by providing an inexpensive silicon band (which I eventually had to purchase) to secure the device; however, they apparently don't care enough about their customers' $100 investments. Although the company was willing to replace the lost device, it took nearly a month for that to happen and the new Fitbit Flex they sent began having technical problems within two months of receiving it (although I should feel lucky, since a friend of mine received a replacement Fitbit Flex that didn't work at all). When I contacted the company about this new malfunction, I was told that my original warranty had expired and that there was nothing they would do for me.

I know that it doesn't give me a specific number read-out for steps taken, nor does it report elevation or heart rate. But it does steps and sleep, and for the price, frankly, that is all I need to know if I am moving enough to satisfy myself. The size makes it reasonably unobtrusive, and gives me that \"Yeah - fitness\" cachet.  And it gets happy when I hit my goal. I would love more specifics - because I like to play with specifics, not because I necessarily need them.  But I am waiting for the general technology of this new industry to come along a little further before I invest in something that I wear constantly close to some main pulmonary conduits.The thing I want to talk about here is this: when I reported the loss of my fit bit, the company responded immediately. They gave me advice about how to find the Flex - a process that actually turned out to be kind of fun and mystical.  I don't register complaints often as I move through the product world, but I will say that I have never had a company be so alert and responsive to a review I've written, to be more concerned about staying in contact with its users, to be more warm, polite and useful.  There are still some arcane things - like, I have had this product and used it happily for about seven months but had never heard of \"fitbit connect\" nor needed to use it (which is a good thing) in all that time.  If I had even registered seeing the phrase, I'd have spared myself a lot of grief in the beginning of this spate of worry. So maybe the basic written copy for this product could be more clear.  But the customer service was impressive.  So in the end, I have found what was lost, and I can go on with my life NOT feeling like the money I spent was wasted.And I will note that this was the first time the Flex had detached itself in seven months.  So whatever problems with bands some other models have had, Flex has been pretty darn great.I am actually terribly sad about this.  I bought the Flex just before we took the whole family to Disneyland - and I was eager to see how far I walked while I was there.  The truth is this: about the Flex itself: it's simple and basic, but I loved it. I have worn it every day and night since last October 18th (2014) or so, and it changed my way of doing things.  I have moved SO much more, because I could SEE what I was doing. I've worn it in the shower and it's been fine. I kind of felt like \"don't leave home without it,\" and it became a familiar pressure on my left wrist. Never had a problem with it coming loose or not working. Enjoyed the computer interface, and even loved the stupid badges (I'm up to New Zealand). But today, I realized that my wrist felt - weird.  And I looked down, and the fitbit was gone.  Just gone. I hadn't done anything out of the ordinary.  I don't remember having my arm under any unusual stress - but the fitbit had evidently dropped off my wrist.  My financial investment gone.  My little conscience gone.  After seven months of continuous and fairly flawless use. In every other respect, I'd give it  five stars, because the thing really did give my aging little grandmother life a boost. But if it's this easy to lose (I felt nothing, had no idea it was loose) - then eventually, it's going to be a waste of your money. I can't buy another one. I hope I can find it, but I've looked everywhere.

I bought it solely as a pedometer, but quickly grew to appreciate the accompanying Fitbit app.  My Fitbit tracks how many calories I burn each day, and I use the app on my smart phone to track what I've eaten.  (The app is worthy of its own review, but the succinct version is that it is very easy to use- I can look up foods by brand or enter my own recipe's nutritional information without much effort.  I can also track other types of exercise and count those burnt calories.)  By setting a goal on my app (I chose a 500 calorie deficit each day) and being diligent about recording my food intake, I've lost 17 pounds in 6 months without stressing about it.  I knew I needed to take action to get fit after having 2 kids and a series of stressful events had led me to significant weight gain, but I really didn't want to go on a \"diet.\"  I don't feel like I'm on a diet- the app program is very similar to Weight Watchers: it just counts calories- and I don't feel like I'm on a fitness regimen, but I'm starting to feel better about myself, and people have started to notice.  There are nights that I find myself pacing around my living room to get 700 more steps and meet my daily goal- it's always a fun surprise when the bracelet vibrates and lights up for several seconds to congratulate me.  I chose the Flex because I liked the sleep tracking function- as a mom of 2 young kids, I am ALWAYS tired.  It may seem silly, but seeing empirical evidence that I wake up an average of 16 times a night (yes, really) encouraged my husband to get up with the baby more often.  The Charge came out shortly after I got my Fitbit, but I would not have chosen that over my Flex.  The Flex is only about half an inch wide, and I don't really notice it on my arm (I wear it 24/7, even in the shower.)  I find the Charge to be too bulky.  I have to charge my flex every 4 or 5 days.  I have 2 chargers for it- one to use if I happen to be sitting at my computer for a while, and the other in my car- that way I don't miss tracking any steps while I charge it. I'd say it takes about 30-45 minutes to charge fully if I wait until I get the e-mail saying my battery is low.  (Can we just reflect for a moment on the fact that my bracelet sends me an e-mail saying it needs to be charged?)  The Fitbit bands are comfortable, are easy to put on, and stay on throughout my daily activity.  They are, however, quite expensive.  I found a 12 pack of off brand bands in various colors and often wear those, though I will say that they come off my wrist a few times a week, often when I'm doing something like moving laundry.  Not a big deal, unless you don't notice it's fallen off and you lose your Fitbit.I'd recommend this product if you're looking to ease into a healthier lifestyle.

Luckily, Amazon was more than willing to send a replacement and let me keep my current unit until it arrived, so while I couldn't sync I could still keep tracking. In the end, I lost about three days worth of data, but with a working unit my experience has been much more positive. I'm glad Amazon cared more about customer service than Fitbit apparently did.The app is pretty well-done; since the calorie tracker has a barcode scanner I've pretty much replaced LoseIt with Fitbit, and the ability to sync other devices to my dashboard means I can keep track of my weight, body fat, etc. with my\u00a0Withings WS-50 Smart Body Analyzer, Black, which I'd originally bought to integrate with LoseIt. Some of the app features are very \"so what?\" such as the sleeping potion, which records sleep and nothing else really, so products like the\u00a0UP 24 by Jawbone - Bluetooth Enabled -  Medium - Retail Packaging - Onyx\u00a0definitely win for app usefulness.

I don't know if they just sent out a really terrible batch of of devices or what, but their response time is terrible for such an expensive and clearly lucrative company.The battery doesn't last quite as long as advertised; I noticed this just a few days in. That's not such a huge issue, but the problems and annoyances kept piling up. My sync dongle crapped out about three days into my having owned the Flex, just refused to show up as connected no matter what port or what computer it was plugged in to, and I ended up waiting over a week for a non-automated response from customer service. I gave them a pretty detailed account of the situation, and received the equivalent of \"Have you tried turning it off and on again?\" Of course I followed every troubleshooting step on the site - I wouldn't have contacted customer service if I hadn't. I wouldn't have minded that useless email so much, If I hadn't waited another full 24 hours for the next response, which basically repeated my words back and and followed up with essentially \"Try returning it for a replacement unit.\" Aside from the fact that its more than possible to replace the dongle separately from the Flex unit (and from the forums I know for a fact that they have), if I'm sending this back to Amazon I'm going to pick up a more dependable product with better customer service in its stead.The Garmin Vivofit is looking pretty good.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RGXAA97W69OA?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_title": "Customer Service is like trying to talk to a bot..."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-03-29", "review_body": "I had a great time with this device.

I've updated it below based on additional time spent with the device: I bought a Fitbit back in September 2013.  It worked reliably until May 2014 when it quit charging.  I contacted Fitbit and received a replacement device as the original one was still under warranty.  After two months of use, the second unit also stopped charging and syncing with my phone or PC.  I contacted Fitbit about the second unit that was sent me, but they failed to respond to my inquiry until several days had elapsed and then only offered suggestions as to a possible fix that I had already considered and attempted without success.While I was initially pleased with the device, I cannot now recommend that anyone purchase it.  If you do buy one, perhaps you might have better luck with it than I did.  I am now looking for an alternate product.  The Fitbit was good at recording my activity and I liked the way it kept track of my caloric intake and consumption, but paying nearly $100 for a product that only lasts several months isn't a good investment.Update (January 15, 2015):  The folks at Fitbit read the complaints I emailed to them and responded by sending me a third unit.  To their credit, this one works.  It will actually take and hold a charge, so I'll give them slight credit for that.  However, the geniuses at Fitbit then decided to \"update\" their app.  Their attempt was a cluster---- in my opinion.  Here's what my Android app now does:  It double enters any exercise I input into it.  If I run for 30 minutes, I dutifully input the data correctly.  As soon as the updated information appears in the exercise-logged portion of the app, it automatically copies itself.  So, instead of the app accurately logging that I ran 30 minutes, it logs that I ran 60 minutes.  I contacted Fitbit support by email and was told to reinstall the app.  I tried it; didn't work.  I was then asked to send a screenshot of the problem to them.  I had already accurately described the problem, but they wanted me to perform a redundant act.  I didn't (just a contrarian, I guess).  Oh, and in the food-logging part of the app, whenever I had added a custom food, guess what happened?  The food was listed twice in the \"custom food\" section of the app.  I was then forced to go through and manually delete the cloned entries.  In some cases there were three or four entries for the same custom food.  Deleting the additional ones was a lovely way to spend a winter evening.  I highly recommend it.If you are considering purchasing this device, caveat emptor.  If you already have this device and are suffering the same problems I am having, you have my condolences. So my opinion of this device remains the same.  However, I do have a slogan for them: \"Fitbit. Not fit for ----\" (rhymes with \"fit\").", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYJH30UNTVQVZ?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 1, "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_title": "An unreliable, short-lived device and the Android app is pitiful"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2016-01-01", "review_body": "I bought 2 of these one for each daughter who is 9 and 11.

I contacted fit bit customer service and they suggest buying Band keepers or strap keepers to help ensure they stay fastened. So after spending $200 I need to spend more so they do not lose them. I am seriously considering sending them back however I need to come up with a plan since they were their gift from Santa Claus ;( Right now they do not want to wear them because they are afraid they will lose them.

I have had my Fitbit for more than a month now. While I won't say the band is 'easy' to snap on, it gets easier. I love, LOVE my Fitbit. Those who object that it is 'just a pedometer' don't understand how much ease of use and ever-present availability of stats on the phone and computer screen can encourage you to be more active. I am not as interested in the 'absolute' of statistics as I am in improving trends. I am more likely to take a few extra steps, or go out and walk up and down the block in the early evening, because I have the fitbit. I am now fully aware of my sleep patterns.

I think this is a fantastic tool and I would recommend it to anyone trying to up their activity level.Some things I have found out while using the device:1. Keep your charger handy where you sit (like at your computer) and charge it up while you KNOW you are not going to be active. It only needs a charge once a week, but it is frustrating to be out walking somewhere and have the battery quit.2.

(See other reviewers for technical comments &amp; comparisons.) The Fitbit app is decent &amp; easy to use. The problem with this Fitbit is the strap (or band) &amp; clasp. First, why package with both the large and small bands? Sell in 2 different sizes (small or large) like with the Fitbit Force, &amp; take some money off the price. Who is going to use both bands? You're either small or large, not both. Luckily, I have a friend who needed another large band. But that is minor. The real problems begin when you attempt to put it on &amp; in wearing it:* It took me 3 hours and a pair of pliers the first time I tried to put it on. The strap is moderately hard, barely flexible rubber. When you have arthritis in your thumbs it is nearly impossible to press the clasp through the band. I understand this may loosen up over time, but it was actually painful to put on.* The strap does not conform to the shape of my wrist. I have a very small wrist and the band tended to \"flop\" around on my arm even when fastened properly. If you have a larger wrist it might fit better.* If you wear it to bed and happen to sleep with your hand/wrist under your pillow, it leaves pressure marks on your arm, even with the band loosely applied as recommended. It is uncomfortable to sleep in.Suggestions for improving the band/clasp system:* Make the band of a more flexible material.* Utilize a different method of fastening. Velcro possibly, or a buckle as on a watch.Alternatives:I have tried 3 different solutions, none of which is perfect, but 2 of the 3 are a vast improvement over the original band/clasp system:* Pocketband.com has a band that appeared to be a solution. Alas, when it arrived it, too, was not flexible enough to put on over my hand AND fit my wrist. Sadly it was $9.00 + $2.25 for shipping &amp; the company only takes returns for incorrect order, defective merchandise, or exchange for size. And the return shipping is on the buyer.* Ribbon Wristband 2-Pack for Fitbit and for Sony Fitness Trackers by Griffin Technology. Made of stretchy ribbon, this band is comfortable, conforms to my wrist and is easy to adjust to size. It slips easily over my hand. 2 problems with these: They are pricey! ($16-$17) The knot, which allows you to adjust the size is hard to undo so that you can loosen or tighten the fit. And the knot is a little unsightly. (Sigh - wish that they, too, would come up with a Velcro closure.) Still much better than the Fitbit band - I can wear it to sleep &amp; not be uncomfortable.* Sleep Sport Band Armband for Fitbit, Misfit, and for Sony SmartBand by Griffin Technology. This is soft, comfortable to wear and is adjustable with the Velcro closure. This is my current first choice. It's only problems are price ($17.30), the Velcro could be a little stronger, and the strap a smidge narrower for my skinny wrist. This is what Fitbit ought to modify or make as their band/clasp system. Very comfortable.Obviously, you can't wear my alternative bands in the shower or while swimming. I'll probably keep the original band for wearing while swimming, but with the other bands, I just take them off for my shower. Seriously, how many steps or how much sleep do you get in the shower?

That's a good question and one that I haven't answered entirely to my satisfaction yet.  I bought a pair of them for my husband and myself as a Valentine's Day present, in lieu of candy (okay, I had a couple pieces of candy, too!).  But anyway, we've had them since mid-February 2015 and are still getting used to them.  They are super simple to wear and charge up fairly easily.  But as a person who's consistently worn a pedometer in my pocket, I'm finding that the fitbit tends to be much lower than what my pedometer shows.  Not by a few hundred steps, either.  So I may have a bum fitbit, I'm not sure yet.  On the other hand, it seems like my husband's is over sensitive and counts plenty of non-step actions as steps.  It's quite frustrating as he's just zooming around with all these steps and I look like a slug, even on days when we do basically the same stuff.  Of course - yeah, yeah, yeah - we could just switch trackers, but the point is - both may be wildly incorrect in their counting of steps, just in different directions.  Since I can't really tell, we've decided to bide our time for a bit longer before sending them back.Now - one big thing that seems to work very well - the Sleep tracker part.

First, I keep losing my Zip/putting it in the wash. Second, I wanted to start tracking my sleep and understand why some days I wake up rested and some days exhausted with the same amount of sleep.The Flex tracks three different sleep categories: asleep, awake and restless. I guess awake is when you get up to go to the bathroom and restless is when you turn over. If you wake up and you can\u2019t go back to sleep and lie very still in bed, it gets counted as \u201casleep\u201d.You are supposed to start and end your sleep log by tapping vigorously on the Flex for two seconds when you are going to sleep, and again when you wake up. Of course, this extra activity is going to guarantee you DON\u2019T go to sleep, if you have trouble falling asleep anyway. I quickly discovered you can log your sleep after the fact, and make your best guess at when you initially fell asleep and got up in the morning. But once you do this it can\u2019t be changed if, for example, your log shows 15 \u201cawake\u201d minutes at the beginning meaning you went to bed later than you thought.I had serious thoughts of returning this for the Charge, which for $25 more gives you automatic sleep tracking plus a display which is present to act as a watch. However, Fitbit\u2019s packaging is definitely NOT \u201cfrustration-free\u201d and the scraps of my box made me think Amazon probably wouldn\u2019t accept the return.I do like the unobtrusive profile of the Flex and the silent alarm works very well.

Once I had it I was sooo impressed, the app is amazing, I counted my own steps sometimes while using it to check accuracy and it is pretty dang accurate. Miles ran match up with what my treadmill and GPS say and the features are awesome. I WAS in love! I basically didn't take it off for five days, until...it ran out of battery. So I plugged it into the charger and NOTHING! It won't charge at all. I went to the website for help, and did every suggested action to try and get a charge and still nothing. I even went on youtube and google to see what other people did and nothing worked. I contacted customer service and they emailed back with some BS generic response outlining things I should try (basically just the list available on their web page that I had already tried in completion).

When I charge it (even for hours and hours) only four lights will flash. No matter how long it charges, I believe it reaches a complete charge the fifth light just never lights up. In normal walking and tracking when I hit my goals etc. the fifth light works exactly how it should, so its not like it is broken. I have read reviews that many other people have this same issue. I am absolutely in love with this product but it is little tweaks and bugs like that, that I really wish the company could get figured out!

But, while Fitbit seems to be the overwhelming leader in this product segment, the small players seem to be a lot hungrier in terms of pushing features on their similar band-style trackers. I ended up going with Fitbit not because of its features, but because I have numerous friends using them, so the social connection could be considered robust. If I didn't care about that aspect, I probably would have gone with a Nobu X by Razer (which, admittedly, seems to have shamelessly copied Fitbit's software wholesale), as it makes far better use of the notification potential some led lights and vibration can bring on one's wrist (at about 2/3rd the price).Fitbit's software is definitely good, though it doesn't appear to sync the battery charge correctly about 30-40% of the time. Initially, it made it seem like I had to charge it every two days, but once I realized how often the battery sync was wrong, and just trusted in the battery, I've been comfortably wearing it all week before charging over a Saturday or Sunday night.Another plus for Fitbit, which had me push it to a 4 is they support Windows, along with iOS and Android. A lot of other companies won't develop for Windows Phone, with a tired excuse that it doesn't have a large enough user base, but it's always wrung a bit hollow with how simple it is to write a mobile app these days.

I really pleased,and am glad I ordered one. In the box, there's a large and small band, the Fitbit itself, the charging cable, and the dongle sync.The instructions are null and void.I had to go online to the Fitbit website to even figure out who to wear it, how to read the lights, how to put the Fitbit into the band. How to wear the band. I had to ask what the lights meant, cause Fitbit's instructions on the website were confusing. I had to ask int he forum. As for the Fitbit itself I love it.Here's how to determine the lights: I use the Android ap on my phone to put it to sleep.I still can't figure out if i tap it a few times, is it asleep, or did I wake it?Snake eyes are sleep indicators.One light is about 25% of your calories, stepping, exercise goal.2 lights are 503 lights are 75etc.For charging, when its fully charged, there are 5 lights. I don't know why Fitbit would say charge to 60%. I charge mine every 4 days, to 100%.The band is a bear cat. I finally put it on my non dominant hand, and turn the band over, so the clasp is on the top. I can then easily clasp it. I've not had any troubles with the band coming loose, but i did order Bitbelt for it. I take it off to shower, so Bitbelt might not be handy. I'm thinking about getting an alternative band, or making one.I'm pleased with what the Fitbit can do,and amazed with every day.

I was most interested in the sleep tracking function, as I am a restless sleeper. The best part about using the Fitbit is that it is compatible with regular computers, as opposed to a lot of other activity trackers that only work with iPhones or Android devices. I can't imagine trying to log my activities and look them up on the dashboard on a tiny phone. I'm really happy that I can see my progress on a full-size computer screen.Finally, I don't need to be told when to exercise or when to start walking as if I'm in an Axis death camp. I like that the Fitbit just tracks my steps and my sleep and I'm welcomed to log other physical activities to keep track of my training. One may even select their logged activities as \"favorites\" and those activities stay in the margin of your screen so that you can just select the activity the next day to log it, rather than re-type the activity into the log.The Fitbit has two metal \"fangs\" that lock into the rubber bracelet very securely. I've not had any trouble with the band coming loose while working out or running through the office halls on a busy day. The whole product is easy to set up and use and you only have to remember to charge it every five days or so. The dashboard reminds you when the battery is low.

Shortly after my wife purchased a Fitbit One, I immediately became jealous.The largest part of my decision to get the Flex was it\u2019s primary wear as a wristband. After experiencing my wife\u2019s One I discovered the size difference was mostly insignificant. That a wristband accessory, suitable for daily wear, would be easy enough to hack up. And so, the shortcomings of the Flex became very significant.

I joined a certain well-known low-cost monthly fitness club and purchased this Fitbit.I love the orange color. It is not bright orange, but still remains vibrant.  It is very close to the photo you see on this page.  I think it is too much of an attention-getting color though for my office, so I also picked up the slate-colored band.  I have average-size wrists for a man I suppose, and I am wearing the large band. I think the small band is for kids, teenagers, or petite individuals.I don't wear a watch, so this is a bit of a change for me to have something on my wrist.  It is hardly noticeable in terms of weight though, so you shouldn't worry about that.  It would have been nice if thos Fitbit displayed the time, since I am wearing this on my wrist after all.It works great for tracking my steps, and I set the default recommended goal of 10,000 steps.  I only accomplished 20% of that goal yesterday, which is indicated by double tapping the Fitbit near the light bar.  Two dots lit up for me, which is 20%.  I can see this will definitely become a motivator, as I will want to reach 100%.  It that way, this is a great device.I noticed it counted about 15 steps during a 20 minute drive home from work, so perhaps my arm movements while driving triggered the counts.The Fitbit pairs via Bluetooth to your smartphone via the app you can get in the iOS App Store or Google Play Store, so don't try pairing it manually via the Bluetooth utility of your phone.  You can also pair it to your PC or MAC using the included dongle.  I wanted to do that, but my office uses a proxy server and Fitbit's PC software doesn't support a proxy apparently.Regardless, once you create a Fitbit account in your app or the software, the Dashboard on their website shows you a lot of information, such as calories burned, steps walked, etc.  There is also a Premium service you can purchase from their website that gives you personal training advice based on data it collects from your Fitbit.Maintaining my daily weight information will be a chore, as will entering the food I eat during the day.  This feeling that this will become a chore is the one flaw I see.  It reduces the Fitbit to nothing more than a stylish pedometer for me if I don't take advantage of these features that require daily data entry.  There are some other features though that might make this worthwhile.  These include sleep tracking and silent alarm.I am not sure the sleep tracker will be useful. I tried it for the first time overnight, and found that I was restless three times last night.  I'm not sure what to do with that information though.  Perhaps change my sleeping position?  Try sleeping on the sofa? Maybe in aggregate, it will tell me something worthwhile.The silent alarm works by vibrating on your arm to wake you up.  It woke me up, but I also set my smartphone's alarm for five minutes later in case the Fitbit did not wake me up.The clasp is difficult to use the first few times you try it.  It gets easier as you figure out how to position it.  The Fitbit is waterproof (according to various sources), so you don't need to take it off often.Overall, I am on the fence about whether or not this is worthwhile.  I suppose if you understand its limitations and know what you are getting when you purchase it, it may be useful to you.  I suggest looking at other options if all you are interested in is a pedometer.  Perhaps, I will find more value in this device with continued use.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IWT18Q8YABNY?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "A Nice Expensive Pedometer Unless You Diligently Use Its Features"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-09-04", "review_body": "It really could use a display that is always on (you have to tap it for it to show what percentage (each LED represents 20%) of your daily step goal you have achieved).  Also, it occasionally goes into \"Sleep\" mode when shaken vigorously when drying hands after washing, but is easy to recover to normal mode.  Charging it every 5 days is a pain since you may be out and about when it quits due to low battery.  The iPhone app and PC software with activity tracker are great.  Subsequently, I bought a Garmin Vivofit which combines pedometer, heart monitor (with strap) since I do a lot of stationary bike work with no arm movement, and watch into one device with a continuous digital display and year long battery life.

I've had the Fitbit Flex since around February and it has changed my life. The biggest impact it has had on me is that it constantly holds me accountable to my exercise and sleep. I have lost 20 pounds so far, by making diet changes, doing strength training exercises, and moving a lot.The Fitbit would not be nearly as amazing without the technology that goes along with it - the website and the app. When I have bluetooth enabled on my phone, my Fitbit data constantly syncs with my phone. I can check the app to see, in real time, exactly how many steps I've taken, how many miles I've walked, and how many minutes of my day have been \"very active\". Within the app or the dashboard of the Fitbit website, you can customize your goals for each of these elements. During my first week with the Fitbit, I just went about my normal life and looked at my data at the end of the week. Then I set my goals for the following week to be slightly higher than the amount I did previously. For example, if I did on average 7500 steps a day, then I set my goal for the next week to be 8000 (500 steps more). Every week I look at my data and set new goals to make sure I am constantly improving and moving more. (By the way, I paid the $50 annual fee to sign up for the Premium account. The Premium part of their website provides you with so much data, weekly reports and graphs about your food if you log it, activities, and sleep. You can also download spreadsheets of your data through the Premium tab. I highly recommend this if you are very data-driven or want to keep track of your progress.)One of my favorite features of the Fitbit is the sleep tracker. Since you always wear the Fitbit, it can track your sleep each night, including how long you're actually asleep for, how long it takes you to fall asleep, and how many times you wake up or are restless throughout the night. This is usually the most interesting part of the Fitbit when I show it to friends.I've convinced multiple coworkers to buy and use Fitbits. Fitbits are definitely more fun when you have friends that use it also. You can add friends, and then within the app or website it shows the rankings among you and your friends in terms of who has the most steps. This is REALLY motivating and fun!! Since getting the Fitbits, we are all motivated to walk more and exercise, partially because we want to be in first place in steps. We also now have a reason to talk about our active lives and what we've been up to, and I've even started working out with some of my friends. It's amazing!I've had people ask me how accurate the Fitbit is. While I can't necessarily speak to its accuracy, I can speak to its consistency. That's good enough for me, because what matters to me is that I'm moving and that I'm moving more every week than I did the week prior.I did very recently start having problems with the battery life of my Fitbit. For the last few months that I've had it, I've only had to charge the battery about once every 5 days. I also set up email and text reminders about when my battery is low so that I never let it die completely. (I don't want to lose any steps or sleep data!) When I recently started having this battery life problem, my battery would drain every 12-24 hours. I tried the troubleshooting tips on the website and then sent an email to their customer service team. They were able to check the system logs and verify the battery life error. After sending them a copy of my Amazon receipt, they sent me a brand new Fitbit package free of charge, and without me having to send in my defective tracker first.I have been very impressed every time I've contacted their customer service team. I also contacted them to see if they have any larger size wristbands. The Fitbit comes with a small and large wristband, but the large is definitely not big enough to fit my dad, who is on his own weight loss journey. After emailing them about the larger wristband size, they got my shipping information from me and sent me an extra large wristband free of charge. Wow! Thank you Fitbit!If you're debating whether or not you should spend $100 on this, I absolutely say to go for it. The motivation and information that I've gotten from this device is worth much more than $100 to me personally. If you're someone that would wear a Fitbit all the time, then it's worth it.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R184VNFJQMTIGM?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "I LOVE love love my Fitbit"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2016-10-23", "review_body": "I love this FitBit - there are a couple of things I don't like about it.

I exhausted all of the troubleshooting options listed on Fitbit's website, and when that didn't worked I consulted the Fitbit Community forum. Lesson learned, folks.Apparently, this is a pretty common problem. About 40% of customers are evidently able to resolve the issue by doing a hard reset on their Fitbit, but the remaining 60% (including myself) are just SOL. Some of the customers who still couldn't get their Fitbit to pair up with the software accepted Fitbit's offer to send them a new unit, but that seems to be pretty hit or miss too. One customer said he's working on his third Fitbit Flex and he's still having the same problems. Given the sheer volume of complaints on the forum alone, I'm pretty surprised Fitbit hasn't taken more aggressive steps to address this. I mean, a Fitbit that won't pair to any software is useless, there's literally no way to view any of the data it's logging. It's just a rubber lame duck tied to your wrist.Two days after I contacted customer service about my issue, I got an email back from a representative who said, and I'm not making this up, that Fitbit had \"confirmed [my] Flex tracker isn't paired yet on [my] Fitbit account\" and to resolve this, I should follow the link included in the e-mail to setup my Flex tracker on my iOS device. So to summarize: in order to fix the issue of my Flex not pairing to my iPhone, I should pair my Flex to my iPhone. I responded immediately to the e-mail trying to clarify what the problem was, since they didn't seem to understand, but they still haven't responded.Honestly, when it works this is probably a 5-star product, but this level of frustration isn't really worth it. If I was the only one this had ever happened to it wouldn't be that big a deal, but there dozens of similar complaints. I wish I'd done more research on their website and scrolled through their user community a bit before I pulled the trigger.

Seems pretty accurate for walking but really isn't designed for working out with weights or weight machines.Things I really like:  - charges quickly and putting the device in the charger is a snap.  - goes about 5-6 days between charges  - automatically sinks with your computer so you can see and track results on the Dashboard.  - Very light and I don't notice it on my wrist.  - I take showers wearing it  - It really gives you a good idea about just how active you are  - I found that I wasn't nearly as active as I had believed.  - Seeing my activity level has really helped motivate me  - The sleep tracking is enlightening and you don't have to remember to activate and deactivate the sleep mode since you can input the sleep times manually. Actually, I like doing it that way because I tended to forget to deactivate sleep mode in the morning.Things I don't like:  - The band tends to be a little difficult to put on but once you get used to doing it, it isn't too bad.  - You have to buy an annual subscription to activate reports. Cost is $50. I use the Windows Snipping Tool to make a record. Sell me a program to do this and I would be alright with it but I don't like the annual fee.I bought one of these for each of my grandsons and they seem to like keeping track of things.

Thus my note are incomplete about this tool for wellness. If the sleep monitoring worked readily and was readily started and clearly stopped, it would be grand. If the exercise monitoring was sensitive to something other than arm movements, then what I carry would not stop the calculations of my steps or running just because my arms are full. If the water-repellency was enough to secure the device in pool, river or sea I might be grateful, except it does not monitor arms in swimming motion. The Flex is grand for monitoring the walking of a person unencumbered by armloads of groceries or a bicyclist or recumbent bike rider if the device is strapped to an ankle, rather than wrist. This is only my 4th day, but tests show it is both limited and adequate for certain types of action.Imagining how it would track me while climbing an orcharding ladder (with minimal arm swings but vigorous climbing) to pick peaches, plums and lemons, I cannot suspect it will work well.The memorization of light patterns and fading is essential to understand what the device tells you in the field... unless you are in constant contact with a smartphone linked to the internet interface.

And then it starts to shut off. Sweat = water, and for a fitness band, this is unavoidable.  The fitbit flex claims to be water resistant.... it's not at all water resistant.  I never showered or swam with the device, but I expect a fitness tracker to be able to stand up to a 6 mile run. My tracker would die 2 miles in from sweat.- Unreliable tracking.  I wore the device next to a garmin wrist worn GPS &amp; there was a dramatic difference.  I usually run the same 6 mile path.... I would have different mileage each day when it worked properly.- The bracelet is nasty after a month of wear.  My black band is chalky white with severe scratches over the window where you see the lights.  It smells bad and has split a little near the window.  I wore this everyday for 2 months (until it broke).... second fitbit after it was replaced was pink.... the window is hard to see through &amp; I didn't get more than a month of wear out of this fitbit before it broke, so the look of the band still looks ok, but the window is hard to see through from scratches. This band smells bad also though, even if it doesn't look chalky.  I have a friend who wears the same fitbit flex.... it also looks pretty beat.  It caters well to someone who dresses down for their daily activities, but it doesn't dress up well &amp; doesn't look presentable or professional for dress up work days.- The clasp started falling off of my flex after about 1 1/2 months....- LONG wait for replacements.  I was a fitbit client for about 6 months, but 1 1/2 months of that was waiting for my replacement fitbit.  Customer service was better in the era of the Ultra.- Customer service is repetitive &amp; not personal (not helpful).... when I inquired about the broken fitbit after a run, they would respond back with how to reset the device.  This happened 3 times.  Word for word, repetitive instructions.  I felt as if they weren't processing the fact that their reset and \"fix\" only worked temporarily.CONCLUSION:I think this might be a good tracker for someone who doesn't sweat for their workout.... someone who walks quite a bit for their activities.  My mom enjoys hers and she's started walking her dog a lot more.  It does NOT work well for someone who sweats daily for their workout.... sweat fills the pocket and kills the widget. If you choose fitbit, I suggest that you own multiple bands so that if you wash dishes, sweat, etc you can put the technology into a new dry band for the rest of your day.I am currently a new Misfit Shine user.  I find all the pros with that company (and it tracks MORE information like swimming, cycling, tennis, soccer, etc to boost!) and the accessories to wear or alternate are great - the Bloom necklace is in my opinion better than the expectant Tory Burch necklace.  All my cons are resolved.... it's waterproof to avoid sweat-death, more precise with tracking, clean looking (however I haven't had it long, but no visible scratches yet on the metal widget), and customer service is quick.  It might not be for everyone, but it's a new brand and I think it will go as far if not farther than fitbit over the next few years.

It transfers your step activities and translates those activities into weight watcher points. You would be amazed how many points your can accumulate on a daily basis just by walking. Walk around your house, pace while you are on the phone, use the bathroom furthest away from you. Those steps add up and as steps add up, so do the points.  You don't have to do hours on a treadmill or laps around the track for the steps to add up. I live in Florida and its too hot to walk outside during the day. You rack up steps by going up and down every aisle in a store whether you need to buy something there or not. The Fitbit has some quirks. If you lay your hands on a grocery cart and not move the arm with the Fitbit, the steps aren't recorded. I have to pull the cart so the arm with the Fitbit can swing freely.

I thought my competitive nature had subsided when I retired. I was wrong. I was at least 30 years older than the other participants and came in at least third but more often first or second. It was great fun and got me hooked on getting those steps.Fitbit also shows you your calorie intake, how many calories you can eat for the rest of the day. You log your food and there catalogue of food is huge. I haven't found a brand that wasn't included.The sleep function is good for you to see when you were awake, when you were restless and how long you slept. If you are like me and tend toward insomnia, it helps that after walking 12,000 to 15,000 steps a day you will sleep at night.I have increased my activity and now I don't have a sedentary life style. The Fitbit has helped and their challenge did indeed challenge me. It is paying off too, at my last weigh in I lost over 3 pounds.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VA3754PZQ7OA?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "If I can do it, so can you."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2016-11-11", "review_body": "I really enjoyed my Fitbit while it lasted.

It is easy to use. It is comfortable to wear..It holds the charge beautifully. I think I charge it about every 5 days, The battery has never gone out.  It accurately measures my steps. It accurately reflects how i sleep .It has helped me increase my activity and loose weight. I synchronize it with my IPod touch and with My Fitness Pal. I downloaded the Fitbit app and can see an analysis of how I am doing throughout the day. . I love how when I hit 10,000 steps the lights brighten and the fitbit vibrates like it is celebrating. I am naturally sedentary and this tool motivates me to move a bit more. It is good for me.

I just got this on May 20th.  I was using the small wristband (because, thankfully, both the large and small come in the package).  Yesterday I noticed the small band already coming apart a little at the face of it where the hard plastic meets the rubber.  So I switched to the large, which is a bit annoying because it is large, but it still works.  So I may have to invest in more bands.Regardless, I have been quite religious about keeping track of my food intake, water intake, etc.  And I have quite a few friends who also own a FitBit of some sort so, in keeping track of their progress as well, it also motivates me to do more!  And I have messaged back-and-forth with a friend or two and my progress is motivating them!  Instead of watching TV sitting down, I have my Gold's Gym stair-stepper and I use this to get in a couple thousand steps.Love being able to track sleep as well.  I always wondered how effective my sleep was and this answers that question.  My sleep is actually quite effective!Unfortunately, there was a bug with my phone (Droid Motorola Rzr M) when they did the KitKat update and the Bluetooth knocks out WiFi so I am forced to get a new, non-Motorola phone, which is okay because I probably needed a new phone.  Of course, the Samsung Galaxy S 5 has its' own fitness tracker band (which basically does the exact same thing as the Fitbit except it also tracks ones heartbeat) but I am hoping the FitBit Flex is still awesome with this phone. :)  I am sure it will be. (This bug was not taken into account with the 4 stars; that rating is due to the band already starting to wear out.)I have lost about 7 lbs just watching my calories (I was never overweight in the first place but this will help me to stay that way).I recommend this product for anyone who does not have a Motorola Droid Rzr M (or, apparently, any Motorola phone with the new KitKat update) at least until the KitKat bugs are smoothed out.Update: 13 Feb 2015Still love my Fitbit!  One thing though, never put it through the wash - still works afterwards but runs out of battery within 24 hours.  So, I went and purchased a new one! The instructions on how to integrate the two are quite easy.  I will possibly give the old one to a friend to try.I have inspired at least three friends to get the Fitbit because I lost so much weight!  (About 18 lbs now.)  I wasn't overweight; just heavier. Believe it or not, I was still in normal BMI, now it is just a lower number, still in the normal range. I purchased a stepper as well (from Amazon, of course) and I have toned up.  My husband thinks it's great and has no problem with my spending habits when it comes to my fitness obsession.  And this is less expensive than a gym membership (which is also difficult to get to with my schedule).The daily challenges help me and my friends who challenge me to stay on course and strive for the 15K steps a day.  I had been keeping track of caloric intake but turns out I don't really eat a lot of calories so I kind of stopped that. But I definitely keep track of water intake.  Living in Utah I need to drink a lot of that.Anyhow, I've rambled long enough.

It can take hours. The online instructions don't work. I've been emailing the company back and forth and still don't have a good answer on how to force a sync. I can see in their online forum that many other users have the same problem. The flex is comfortable, and I assume that it is counting my steps fairly accurately. As for sleep, forget about it. If you are inactive for a long time - reading at your computer for example, it will think that you are asleep. I never told the fitbit that I wanted it to track my sleep and never set a goal, but suddenly one day it congratulated me for sleeping over 10 hours and exceeding my goal of 8. What was most disturbing, though, was that it told me that I was sleeping at work! So if you just want to track your steps and don't care about specifics beyond meeting 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of your daily goal, then it works fine. If you want to know where you are in order to know if you need to take more steps to meet a weekly goal in the last few hours, forget about it.Another thing that I don't like about the flex is that it keeps track of your weekly goal on a rolling basis. You can choose whether to start on Sunday or Monday, but it still tracks you with the prior week's daily totals. That forces you to keep your own spreadsheet to know how close you are to your weekly goal until the last day of your week.

I will say that as some have said, the Fitbit is extremely sensitive to vibrations, for instance when I worked in retail during nursing school before starting at the hospital, I would be pushing carts and the vibrations going through the parking lot would set the thing back and forth between sleep and active mode, negating a LOT of my steps. And as others have pointed out, any time your wrist is in a stationary position (pushing a cart, sweeping with a push broom, carrying something) the flex picks up none to very few of your steps (you can observe this if you set it to constant syncing on your phone). And on the flip side, it counts pretty much anything that makes your wrist move as walking/running, often ridiculously so (for instance if you are using a hammer or boxing, the jarring motion on your wrist just from one punch or a few hammer strikes can be counted as 5+ steps, adding up very quickly). I have found it best practice to just take the fitbit off ahead of time for these activities, otherwise I know i will be forced to constantly reset it to active mode and/or realize my steps are dramatically over counted for that day.I will say that the battery functions better than many have claimed, I have no problem at all getting 7-8 days out of it. I usually charge on Sundays nights (only takes 1-2 hours), but have forgotten and it is still going strong (although it reads low battery) all through to Monday night.One function I don't use hardly at all, and put little faith in is the sleep tracker. Maybe it works well for others but I have tried the standard and the sensitive settings and more often than not it just seem way off. I have timed against it for periods I know I have woken up and walked around then gone back to sleep and sometimes it doesn't even show I woke up during the night, or it goes the other way and shows I woke up for periods of 5+ minutes multiple times through the night when I know that wasn't the case.Overall, its not a bad device, but realistically it could deal with a LOT of improvements. I have used far cheaper belt-clip style pedometers that track steps extremely more efficiently than this device. Also, as others have pointed out, since it doesn't have the other plane sensor (an altimeter I believe, but don't hate if that's incorrect) it has absolutely no idea when you are going up and down stairs, and I've found that despite going up 3-5 flights of stairs it only tracks, if I am lucky, the steps I have taken on each landing...", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Q6111T3W6W6I?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Fairly satisfied with my purchase overall"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-12-24", "review_body": "I was unhappy with my Fitbit Zip because with its clip design, I had a tendency to lose it; when I had one long enough to need a battery replacement, as soon as I put a new battery in, the Zip stopped working, or working accurately. I notice other people experienced this problem as well. Anyway, I liked the Flex idea because I wanted a sturdy wristband, and also a tracker that I could plug in to re-charge.The Flex does have these qualities, as well as giving you a nifty buzz when you hit 10,000 steps. However, what the Web site does not mention anywhere, and I didn't see it in the negative reviews that I did read, is that IT HAS NO DISPLAY AT ALL. At least with my Zip, I could tap it at any time and immediately know how many steps I had taken. All you have on the Flex is a line of little lights. For every 2K steps you take up to 10K, you will get a steady light (if you take 3K steps, you will have one steady light and the next one flashing). There are several inherent problems with this: If you have four solid lights and one flashing, you have no idea if you need another 900 steps to reach 10K, or only 50. Additionally, once you reach the 10K, you have no idea at all how many more steps you have taken. To find out, you would have to sync on demand. This feature sometimes works on Fitbit Connect and sometimes not, but either way, I don't have a Smart phone and don't always feel like booting up my computer just to get a step readout.I don't know if I can return this (trying), but if not, I hope it dies soon so I can get something that is actually efficient.

I still love it when it works, but it has stopped working. It will no longer take a charge. the battery run s down and I can't charge it up again. It is now useless. I bought two new battery charges, but that did not help. Please don't buy this. I am working with fitbit and Amazon on a replacement. I want to try the fitbit charge, as my daughter has one and loves it.****** end of updateFirstly, I want to make it clear that my favorite fitbit product is the zip. It doesn't depend on wrist movement and it has an easy to read display and tells time. It does not have to be recharged and the battery life is relatively long.So why am I wearing a flex? Well, I bought 5 zips for various members of my family. We sort of  compete. Two of the zips were broken (user carelessness, not a product problem), and one was lost (mine). Also we often would forget to wear the thing.So I bought a flex that I never have to take off except to charge, and it is unlikely that I will drop it. That is the sole reasons that I bought it. It seems to be accurate when compared to my wife's zip. It would probably be useless for someone that uses a stationary bike, or cycles as it depends on wrist movement. I use an elliptical machine that promotes arm movements, but if it did not, I would not get my steps.It supposedly will track sleep, but I find that to be totally irrelevant. I take mine off at night. The only display it has are five small lights that will give you an approximate percentage of where you are in reaching your goal. To get a true count of my steps I must sync it with my smart phone, which is easy, but not as easy as looking at a display. The charge has lasted me for at least a week. I have not let it run down completely. The band that comes with it appears to be cheap plastic, at any rate it looks like cheap plastic, but it is light and I don't notice it on my wrist.I rate it four stars because it fits unobtrusively  on my wrist and does what I want it to do.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MQTGNYQ7X2A7?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 1, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Fits my needs but ...."}], [{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-07-20", "review_body": "Works ok at the main reason I bought it which was motivation.

Comes with two bands which was good for both my wife and I and she needs the tiny one and I needed the larger one. One positive is being somewhat water resistant. I do not dunk my hands in a pool of water by all means but I do not take it off when in the shower. Cleans up real nice as well. Popping the electronic out is fast and easy.Easy to sync, but the accuracy of the data depends on other things as referred to in the next part.If I am driving and tapping the steering wheel (which I have a tendency to do with some rocking tunes), I do not need to find out that I just ran 3 miles because it is counting each movement of my arm. It is picking up every movement and just counting it. No regard for the fact that I am doing 80 down the highway which is impossible for a man/woman running or walking whatever.

Their mobile apps is alright, their web app is actually pretty decent. Ideally, I'd want a device in this form factor to measure my heart rate and log it continuously. But this one measures paces. OK, best we can do for today, I'll try it.Riding to work on my motorcycle, I got credit for taking 10,000+ steps. It gave me haptic feedback a few times, blinked lights every now and then, all in all a particularly senseless/useless pattern of feedback. Sometimes it would go into sleep mode inexplicably. Oh, yeah, sleep mode... I should touch on that.How does it log your sleep? You have to tap it hard, repeatedly, and rapidly until it gives you the haptic feedback and blinking light routine to indicate that it's now tracking your sleep. Even though you aren't yet asleep. And when you wake up, you have to remember to go through that routine all over again. It's not smart enough to know when you're sleeping or when you're awake.

You can set your goals to whatever you want, input all the information about yourself (height, weight, age, etc.), and let the Fitbit do it's thing.  It works so well.  The step count is not 100% accurate, but it's usually only off by a few steps each day.  Out of 10,000 steps a day, I think 10 steps off is pretty darn accurate.  I am trying to convince all of my friends to buy one of these now so we can challenge each other.  It's really not hard to burn more calories a day than you eat...you just need to track everything food and drink item you put in your mouth so that you can really be aware of what your body is getting each day.  There are some things I don't even bother drinking or eating anymore (like Starbuck's Frappuccinos...as delicious as they are) because I don't want to waste that many calories on something that gives me no fulfillment.

You should aim to burn 1,000 more than you eat a day, but if you struggle with setting your goals so high that you intimidate yourself and cannot achieve your goals, then this is definitely what you need to get.

I purchased this monitor in the slate color and the small band fit well. I have had no problem with this monitor coming off or with the clasp as some have mentioned. I wore my flex 24/7. I wore it while exercising, in the shower, while sleeping. I found the tracking to be fairly accurate. I found the online dashboard and the fitbit app and integration with other fitness apps, to be very helpful.The problems started about 3 months into using the flex. I normally used the flex's vibrating alarm to wake up in the morning, which is great for not disturbing one's partner. However, my alarm started to fail. It would not go off and I would log onto my dashboard to find it was not even set to on! This was strange but after it happened several times (resulting in my oversleeping for work), I concluded that this was not a user error but some kind of glitch with fitbit's dashboard. I would set the alarm to on, and eventually it would simply turn itself off. So, back to the good old alarm clock.Next problem came at 4 months. The charge held for less and less time. Initially I would charge the flex on sunday of each week. I would get a email reminder when the battery was low and usually had a day or two before it went dead. Well, now the battery goes dead within 3 days of a full charge. In addition, there is no warning email. It might be working fine at lunch and by dinner totally dead. No lights, no nothing.So now I have to charge every 3 days and can't use the silent alarm. The flex is now more of a nuisance than a fitness aide. I will add that I bought a 3 pack of extra bands. The colors are neat but the bands tend to look worn fairly quickly...like after two months of wearing it all the time.So now I've spent $130 on a device which was fully functional for only 4 months. I don't bother to wear it at all now, since I cannot confidently get a week's work of consistent data (used to love the weekly report).Overall, it's a great device for as long as it works but it doesn't work for long. At this price point, it is not worth it.It definitely encouraged me during the beginning phases of getting in shape. I have found that those who have established fitness routines, diet, etc, really won't benefit much from using the device.

They say you can wear it in the shower, but I haven't yet - no real reason other than I take my watch off, so the Fitbit comes off too.When I use the treadmill, I attach it to the top of my shoe or wear it around my ankle if my socks don't get in the way. When you hold onto the handles of the treadmill, the step count may not be accurate without the combination of arm and leg movement.The sleep monitor function is fairly accurate because I also have a Sleep Number bed that has the Sleep IQ feature and it monitors my sleep/wake patterns, (as well as heart and breathing rates), and the figures between the Fitbit and Sleep IQ match up pretty well. Actually the first night, in the morning when I attempted to change it to \"awake\" I wasn't wearing my glasses but thought I got it.

I have a nice pocket pedometer (Omron), have used free food tracking sites, and have kept a little spreadsheet that helped me track what worked for weight loss.  I don't have a smartphone. I wondered if a Flex was an excessively complicated electronic way to get to the same results.  However, the last 20 pounds of a massive and permanent weight loss was getting to me, and $100 seemed like a reasonable investment.  This little electronic gadget simplified my life and gave me information I didn't know I was missing.  It tracks my steps, I track my food in the same place, the dashboard tells me if I am off track.  I track my sleep, and specific workouts.  All tracked and in one place with little effort. The biggest revelation was the bar graph of daily activity in 15 minute sections.  I can tell when I sit too long, and my behavior has changed. It turns out that an alarm for sitting 30 minutes (offered by other brands) wasn't necessary.  I just needed to see my patterns.  I'm making progress on my weight because I'm confronted with the truth.  Highly recommended.Not having a smartphone doesn't matter.

I want to be upfront I only bought the fitbit as a short term solution. I believe a lot of new devices will be released and I wanted something relatively cheap to use in the interim.Now on to the fitbit. It does record activity but I am not sure how accurately. For example over the last three days I ran for over 30 minutes, rowing machine 40 minutes x 2, and cycling for 50 minutes. During those four days I broke the 10,000 step goal twice and have 16 \"very active minutes\", just to be clear that is  NOT 16 minutes a day but 16 total for the 4 days.  For all of those activities I wear a heart rate and my BPM ranges from 130 - 170, so I am pretty positive they are \" very active minutes \". That leads to the question what is this thing measuring?A few other notesBattery life is good, every time I've charged the device it had at least half a charge.Measuring sleep is not automatic, you have to tell the device you are sleeping either through the app or web page. You can also enter your sleep time the next day so it really isn't to bad an inconvenience.Not really fond of the rubberized band but all these devices use it, so get used to it.I am going to try the fitbit out for two weeks so hopefully I can update the review with more stars later.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EFHKH4RUNYMM?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "not sure about the integrity of the data."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-01-29", "review_body": "Run!

I started my Fitbit collection with the Fitbit One for both my wife and I. I wasn't happy with the clip provided as it was as loose as a West Fargo girl at prom. The clip that came with my wife's device was fine, but my Fitbit One fell out of the clip to often. I had it clipped to my belt and before the end of the 2nd week it was lost.I contacted Fitbit support and lodged my complaint and within 2 weeks I had a replacement. FANTASTIC customer support. I kept this replacement Fitbit One in my pocket to be safe, but never had a problem with the device falling out of the properly fitted clip.The next Fitbit device I purchased was the Aria. The device is great and fairly easy to use. I was able to setup the device quickly and it was well worth the $$ spent. It is easy to use and if for some reason a reading is bad or accidentally applied to another user of the device, it is easy to reassign or delete the reading.I really liked the idea of the Fitbit Force, so before Christmas of 2013, I decided to upgrade my One. While browsing, I found an incredible deal and ordered a new Fitbit before I realized I had ordered the Flex and not the Force. Of course I was initially disappointed that I had ordered the wrong product, but in the end it worked out as the Force was recalled not to long after. I really like the Flex as it picks up a lot of activities that I do where only a small portion of acceleration is done by my waist such as rowing, lifting and other activities where the focus is with the arms. I miss the elevation stats I had with the One, but I still prefer to wear the Flex as opposed to carry the One.This spring I picked up a new Fitbit Zip.

I really liked the slim look and the color bands with the felx so I purchased this second one. After receiving this second one I was more cautious using it. Took it off before showering, didn't wash dishes it in, took it off in the rain, put it in my pocket instead of on my wrist if I was really active and sweating a lot to prevent what I thought was a water issue with the first one.

A quick online chat with Fitbit customer service and they determined it was not working and sent a replacement. The replacement also stopped being accurate for long walks within 3 months.

For four days, I use an elliptical trainer and weight training. On two days, I do Pilates and use a treadmill. I thought since the Fitbit tracks the number of steps I take, that it would work on the elliptical trainer - not so much. The machine tells me I ran 3.5 miles while my Fitbit says I walked 2.4 miles.Although the treadmill was far more accurate since I was running, I also want credit for the other workouts I'm doing such as the Pilates and weight training. There's nowhere to enter those activities into the app, so you just have to do it for staying healthy (which you should, but it defeats the point of the Fitbit, am I right?)Sleep TrackingBefore you go to sleep, you set the Fitbit into sleep mode by tapping it for 2-3 seconds. This mode switching works easily enough and the Fitbit gives you a summary of your night's sleep patterns separated into three categories - sleeping, restless and awake. Sounds good, right?So, what's the problem here? I have a floofy cat (appropriately named \"Floo\") who enjoys singing the song of his people on a daily basis around 4:45 a.m. He wanders into my bedroom and meows his floofy little head off until I wake up, get out of bed and punt his floofy butt out of the room.Every night I wore the Fitbit, Floo came into the room and performed his show causing me to get out of bed and remove him from the premises. The Fitbit tracked NONE of these occurrences. In fact, the Fitbit showed that I wasn't even restless (much less awake), acting as if I slept through the entire night.Calorie TrackingThe Fitbit apps includes a Calorie Tracking Diary with an extensive database of different foods and calories. This is a nice feature, however since you need to add your calories manually, I expect many Fitbit owners wouldn't use this feature.In addition, there are many Smartphone apps like MyFitnessPal's Calorie Counter app for iPhone, Android, Blackberry and more, which have much more extensive food databases and can be downloaded for free or very cheap.Not Motorcyclist CompatibleI know what you're thinking: \"'Not motorcyclist compatible?' Um... what?\" Yes. I ride a cruiser and whenever I rode the cruiser, the vibrations going through my wrist would make the Fitbit change into Sleep Mode which would mess up my sleep tracking. (In case you're curious, no, motorcyclists cannot sleep while riding).OverallThe Fitbit is a very neat idea for wearable technology that's not quite ready for prime-time. If Fitbit can develop a tracker that more accurately tracks all kinds of activity including physical and sleep, maybe I'll give it a try.For right now, unless you're an early adopter who tolerates a lot of deficiencies in a device just to have the newest technology, I recommend waiting until Fitbit fully bakes their concepts.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I8NFHGACRM7T?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "A brilliant idea poorly executed -or- If you exercise without walking, jogging, or running, Fitbit isn't for you."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-03-04", "review_body": "There are thousands of reviews out there that will tell you mostly what I will say, so here's the summary. The tracker works well and is accurate. Be sure to set it up and calibrate your walking and running strides and you should't be dissatisfied. The integration with MyFitnessPal and other apps/sites is really quite exceptional. The wristband (black on mine) is awful. The first one started tearing at the joint between the silicone and the translucent window, within just over a month of daily wear (which was only 5 cycles of taking the tracker out and replacing it after charging!!!). Warranty replacement went well, but I did have to send in pictures (yes, plural) of the defect and wait almost 2 weeks to get a replacement. The replacement tore in the same spot about 3 months later. I said to Hell with it and used my wife's unused grey band and it's been holding up well. MUCH better than the black. Then the tracker went crazy and vibrated, flashing 2 dots and nothing else for about 30 seconds. I do have a silent alarm set, but at 3:45 AM weekdays, not Noon-ish on a Saturday! Upon syncing with my iPhone, I got a red X in the battery and nothing else.  Mind you, this was the same day I took it off the charger so it was 100% charged that morning. I scoured the support sites and tried everything, oftentimes twice. No avail. This time, customer service told me to try syncing it again. Then they told me to charge it. Then they told me to reset my phone (the problem was my phone?!?!?!?!). Nothing worked so I gave up on it for about 2 weeks. I then put it on the charger and it's been working ever since. In short, not at all reliable in the long term but I'm using it until it dies again. Would I buy another Fitbit? No way! Especially with the issues they are having with the Force bands.

I can't say enough how easy it is to return defective products to Amazon, very user friendly. Now for the flex. I'm totally sold on fitbit, yes I have a few. . I  started out with the Surge. The surge is a great product in its own right, but is too bulky for me to wear every day in the hot summer. If you need all the bells and whistles the surge is the way to go. The surge also costs 250.I needed heart rate monitor sometimes because my health sucks. I'm 46 and I've had 2 mild heart attacks and now have  chronic idiopathic pancreatitus. I spend a lot of time in bed, but I still need to do some easy physical activity, which for me is walking. Since the surge was too sweaty and bulky for me in the summer months, I tried the Charge HR next.  I really like that one too, but it cost 149..but it's alot less bulky and has a great accurate enough heart rate. But it still got sweaty under the wrist and I was worried about it getting harmed when I do my housework. So then I got the flex.. The flex is very slim and can be loosely worn because it doesn't track heart rate.. Which for me is fine for most days when I don't need all the features. So no sweaty wrist, and, you can purchase many different types of replacement bands to match your outfit. The flex does track, steps, calories, miles and sleep which must be turned on manually. The flex also only costs about 80 bucks so I'm not as concerned about it getting wrecked doing heavy duty spring cleaning. The cost also makes it easy to  get introduced to fitbit. The software and app are amazing and very social and user friendly. The app also allows you to hook up different trackers and set your goals up for what you want to do. Having friends on the app allows you to compete and stay motivated too. The flex uses 5 LED lights to help you see how you are doing through the day. Each light represents 20% of your goal. For me, I find the lights more motivating than having the raw data on  my wrist because you have to work harder to get all the lights and complete the goal for the day. And, unlike the surge and charge that need to be charged every 3 days, the flex only needs to be charged once a week which is a lot easier if you like me have a crazy busy life..

While wearing them, the strap just fell off.  I liked how fitbit measured my activity and sync with myfitnesspal.  However I have lost two $99.00 purchases for a device that has a crappy wrist holder.  I am. very disappointed.  For a 99.00 purchase, this strap is crappy for a design.----------------------------------------------- 2nd review written on September 17thUpdate - I contacted the Fitbit support team and was timely answered back within 24 hours. After reading how I've lost my last two Fitbits due to the flimsy wristband falling off, Fitbit will be sending me a new Fitbit Flex replacement at no cost.  I was asked to show a receipt for my proof of purchase and since I buy a lot of things like the fitbit online, I had no problems creating a screenshot from the online stores I shop from, so it was an easy replacement procedure!So for this Fitbit Flex review, I have to give Fitbit 5 stars for customer service. I also give 5 stars for the Fitbit Flex product use because it's excellent in tracking calories with myfitnesspal.  I use Fitbit Flex daily!  However I will be giving it 1 star for product design (yes that sounds harsh, however that lower score raises eyebrows for a reason), because the flimsy wristband is an issue for regular Fitbit Flex users.  We shouldn't have to loose a Fitbit, or god forbid, two, in order to discover how the wristband can just fall off.  I've worn watches all my life, and none have ever fallen off my wrist, so shouldn't the Fitbit Flex follow the same expectation?Likewise at $99.00 a purchase, for me it's not economically feasile just to buy a new one, if the last one fell.  We consumers should not loose a product from a design, which we have no control of, from falling apart.  We are not intentionally breaking the wristband, instead it can break over its flimsy material.So I upgraded this Amazon review to 3 stars out of 5 (originally I gave it 1 star, because at the time I was very upset how the Fitbit just disappeared off my wrist, but my review has now changed, and I'm no longer in a nasty mood :) - by still giving kudos to the Fitbit customer support team, and their fairness in providing me a replacement, as well as my daily use of the Fitbit Flex product by tracking calories.  Yet I am also withdrawing stars (out of the total 5) to shine a critical eye to other consumers on a potential defieciency with the Fitbit Flex product with the wristband.I also think other Fitbit Flex consumers should investigate the 'O' band.

The Fitbit Flex is a pretty good answer. It's discreet, you charge it less than your cell phone, and it notifies you through interfaces you likely are already using everyday, like smartphone or web apps. All the while, it's passively counting your steps and letting you know how far away you are from your walking goal. Measuring progress is key to so many things in life. And with Fitbit, all you have to do is put on a bracelet.Fit also has some other features, such as sleep tracking, caloric intake, weight, and body fat. The sleep tracking is an OK feature to have, but having to tell your fit bit with a series of taps that you're going to sleep is a bit of a hassle (if you forget to put it in sleep mode, you can enter in the time you slept after you wake up and it'll still show your sleep patterns). But aside from slight movements and actual awake times, it doesn't give you a clearer picture of things like your heart rate or breathing patterns.Caloric intake is even more of a chore. To calculate it, you have to track everything you're eating. While there are resources that provide general estimations of what you're eating, and a list of foods that you eat regularly, having to input what you eat after every meal is tedious at best. If you do take that route, you can get a much clearer picture of what you need to do to reach your activity and weight goals, but miss a few days, and it's easy to lose track altogether.Lastly, if you purchase the Fitbit Aria scale, you can upload weight, body fat, and BMI measurements wirelessly to your Fitbit account. Now this feature does work like magic. Once it's set up, you simply step on the scale, and the data shows up in your app. That convenience comes at a price, however, at a hundred bucks a pop in addition to the flex, the combo can be price prohibitive.So why a two star review? Water resistance. For clothes it makes sense, walk in a storm, and you'll stay dry for the most part. The worst that can happen is you feel a little damp. For electronics it's a different story. Take it in the shower, it'll work. Take it for a long bath, and there goes your $100 investment down the drain. You get so used to using this thing that you forget you're wearing it, which can be both a blessing and a wasted investment.Long story short, great device, wonderful interface for it's key pedometer feature, a bit of a drag for everything else. Be smart about it and keep it dry, or you might end up with a dead Fitbit like mine.UPDATE: Shortly after I posted this review, I was contacted by fitbit. They asked me to try to reset my flex, and that didn't work. So they're shipping me a brand new Flex. And while that doesn't account for all the short comings of this device, the positive customer experience is enough to bump this review up another star.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPUJ9YY503S8P?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Water resistance: Great for clothes, bad for Fitbit"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-09-21", "review_body": "Updated review: After 6 weeks, it fell off somewhere and is now lost.

Of yet the only problem with it is sometimes difficulty closing it, but I rarely take it off. I can see how it will become an issue, though.The biggest problem for me is as follows. The first couple of nights, I tapped the thing repeatedly to get it into sleep mode. Each subsequent morning, I'd do the same and regardless, it would happen within a matter of seconds (no more than 3 or 4). Now, having had it (and worn it in the shower and ocean - but less than 10M), the tapping seems to be a lot less successful and I often have to tap repeatedly for 10 or more seconds. It's highly annoying and does not bode well moving forward.I haven't used the food app so I can't speak for it. It does sync with My Net Diary, which is the food diary/app I use. However, I didn't like Flex's calorie and mileage counts so I have just started inputting to My Net Diary based on what Runkeeper tells me for walking and running.Not sure if I'd buy this again, to be honest.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M7H25NAVX9KS?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 4, "review_title": "A disappointment - or maybe I need to adjust my expectations."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-09-18", "review_body": "The Fitbit is a FABULOUS tool!!

No difficult things that require a lot of vision, coordination, or anything troublesome. BUT IT DOES NOT WORK WELL and it has not from the first day. Sometimes I can press it and it will connect. Other times the only way is to put the clasps on the lowest hole and then slowly yank it over my knuckles even though when it finally settles on my wrist it is quite loose.

In fact, I LOVE my flex.PROS1. It tracks fairly accurately. I wear it on my non-dominant wrist with sensitivity set to normal. I tested it by wearing my regular old pedometer simultaneously for the first few days, then comparing the step counts. The two devices register &lt;100 steps difference on any given day.2. Since I can wear it in the shower, I don't ever forget it, because it's always on my wrist.3. The fitbit dashboard, apps, community, etc. are excellent!4. It has motivated me so much over the past month - I really want to get all those lights solid every day.CONS1. I've been using it just over a month, and it stopped holding a charge for longer than a day, even though background sync is turned off.2. It has stopped syncing correctly, and I have had to reset it several times over the past few days.3. I noticed a rather good sized crack in the flex near the charging contact points - this despite that I have taken very good care of it: I take it off when I swim in the ocean (avoid salt), I take it off when I wash dishes (avoid hot water), and have only ever cleaned it by rubbing it gently with a cotton ball. It has also always been kept in the wristband or the charging cradle.4. I wonder if it was a used/returned flex, because when I set it up, it had data in it from February, and it was only delivered to me on August 12. At any rate, not too keen on spending $100 on a used device that breaks after a month.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RE4DZ7NNZ3SEA?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 1, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Updated Review - Disappointed Again."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-10-08", "review_body": "Way beyond my expectations. I use this with my \"myfitnesspal/MFP\" acct and it sync's to it and adjusts my calories and all that jazz, so I don't log my food on the fitbit because I do that on MFP instead. I also went into my MFP acct and allowed fitbit to have my calories adjusted in the negative (this is not a default setting, you must do this-must do on website not app). If you work-out then in MFP will have you to tell it the exact time and for how long and it'll make adjustments so you won\u2019t have an error increase on your calories usage (MFP will make all the adjustments in calories for you) Pretty cool.I know people have remarked that it's not calculating their steps correctly so they then put it on their ankles. The fitbit is a pretty sophisticated device, it's not just about counting steps but rather movement. You can put it on your non-dominant wrist or adjust it to be less or more sensitive if you've got issues that way. For example when I'm walking into work I'm always carrying stuff in the same arm that the fitbit is on and it knows I'm walking and counts my steps (I opened my app with my other hand and just watched it count the steps) then I go to talk to someone and use my arm (hand talking...) that has the fitbit BUT it didn't count the steps because it knew I wasn't walking or major movement. Pretty awesome device if you ask me. The only time it didn\u2019t count my steps was pushing a shopping cart and I put it in my pocket and it resumed. So carts, strollers are an issue, so put it in your pocket or in shoelaces, ankle... I also really like the sleep monitoring too. Overall It's a real eye-opener to self-awareness on if you're sleeping and are as active as you think you are.

After wearing it and loving it every day for about 9 months, my fitbit started periodically faulting out.  No communication, loses memory of my activity. Now I can't wear it for more than a few hours before it faults out. Very frustrating.  Downgrading to 3 stars.I love my fitbit!  It was a little embarrassing when I first got it (apparently, I was a slug,) but it gave me the incentive to not spend so much time sitting down at home.  I've had it now for several weeks and rarely meet my step goal, but I have increased my activity level quite a bit, so I'm on track.  Once the weather cools off, i'll start daily walking and expect to meet the goal more frequently.Helpful comments:1.  It tracks activity via hand movements.  It actually records vigorous hand washing as \"very active\" time.2.  It tracks my sleep.  I learned I get less sleep than I thought. I also learned that the more active I am, the more I sleep, and the less I sleep, the less energy I have.  So even though I'm too tired to exercise, I have been forcing myself to move, and it's helping.3.  OK, it's plastic.  Not very attractive as-is.  BUT - with superglue, a toothpick, and some very tiny rhinestones, I have (almost) a fashion statement.  I'll post a photo later.4. Has a very nice cell phone app, and an even nicer computer app.  Helps you track all your health stats, and keeps a nice historical record.5. You can link to (and cheer on) your friends.

I got the Fitbit flex because I wanted to start on the wrist-worn Fitbit products. I have had this product for a month now and I really like it! The band snaps on and off easily. Usually I don't like things on my wrist because I have a desk job, but the profile of the Flex is pretty slim and it doesn't bother me. It does a pretty good job about tracking steps and active minutes if you are doing exercise outside. Another perk is it comes with different sized bands and you can buy after market ones here on Amazon. Whereas Fitbit products like the Charge (and the like) come in pre-defined sizes you're stuck with, because the tracker is built in. This tracker is removable which is a real perk for cleaning and charging.A couple of downers about it are when working out in the gym doing treadmill and elliptical workouts, it hasn't been very accurate about counting my steps, so I have to add the exercise manually. I think it has something to do with the accelerometer inside of it, my suspicion is it doesn't know your pace if you aren't \"actually\" moving forward, like you would outside.Another downer is see your daily progress you have to tap the band a couple times, which doesn't bother me too much because I had a Fitbit One. However, I have a 2 month old and whenever I burp her the vibration causes all manner of functionality between viewing my progress on the band to activating manual sleep/activity mode. I also noticed this happens when pushing a stroller on a bumpy sidewalk. I tried to manually track a walk like that and it kept deactivating/activating activity mode every couple minutes.I looked every where to find out how to manually track activities using the flex, but I couldn't find a solid answer. This isn't really a negative on the product, but rather the Fitbit Documentation. Since, on the Fitbit One you just push and hold it's button for sleep and manual activities. I decided to give it a shot on the flex and put it in manual sleep mode and it tracked my activity the same way, which is very cool, but not really documented anywhere.I have read that you can clean the band using Cetaphil face wash if you have one of the color ones. You will need to take the tracker out to do this.

I should've given them more credence when I purchased mine.If you are looking for a tracker, I STRONGLY suggest the Fitbit One. The Fitbit One does everything this Flex doesn't; i.e., it works properly.Although I've only had it 3 days, I am returning it. That may seem like too short of a time to give it a fair review, but I would have to disagree. I own the Fitbit One and it was a snap to use right out of the box. I have never experienced a single problem with it. I was hoping the Flex would work as flawlessly, but, not so much. Let me describe the problems I've had since I received it.1. I could not get the band to stay closed on my wrist. I had to have someone else snap it closed as it does not snap together easily.2. I initially could not get it sync. I actually had to google \"how to get my Fitbit Flex to sync\" because I could not get it to work with the directions given on the Fitbit site. This may sound like I'm incompetent, but I had no problems with my Fitbit One.3. It doesn't track my steps accurately. It routinely indicates that I have walked less than half the steps I typically walked using my One - even after adjusting for stride length.4. I could not get it log sleep at all, even though I followed the instructions.5. It won't sync unless the device is right over the dongle - seriously, within 6 inches. The One would sync just about anywhere in my house.6. Also annoying is the fact that you have to see your results on the computer or phone app if you have the right kind of phone. The list of phones is very small and as of my purchase, it was not available for the HTC Evo. The device DOES NOT display your steps - you will have to sync each time to see your results.

I purchased this item in black. I was a pre-order customer, so I ordered it in March and received the FitBit on May 21st. By July, I had to send you a message that my tracker was not charging properly. It took days for someone to get back to me- by then I had managed to charge it by physically holding it in place in the charger and tying a rubber band around it. So the email reply I got from FitBit service was \u201cwe see your fitbit has been charged and synced.\u201d No help at all. So then I purchased a second charger- at $25-  thinking maybe it was that. I had my IT department check my USB ports on my computer. I tried using my husband\u2019s computer. I tried using a MAC instead of a PC. I tried using a USB hub. I tried cleaning it per your instructions. I tried resetting it per your instructions. Nothing worked.There are dozens of negative reviews on Amazon.com from FitBit users who are having the same problem. You really need to rethink the charging mechanism, as well as the design of the bands- all of mine are tearing now where the rubber part meets the window on the inside part of the band- I guess when you pop the tracker out to charge it or to change the band color, this puts wear and tear on the band. I purchased replacement bands (blue, orange, navy) only 6 weeks ago, and already the orange and navy are torn. My black one is also torn and I have had to use the large size black band ever since. I am so disappointed- the FitBit has been a great motivator and I love using it with my RunKeeper app- but the quality of the accessories and the charging situation really need to be revisited by you all.Please advise what you plan to do next to remedy the situation.

I ended up returning the FitBit Flex. Here's what I have to say.- Both the FitBit Flex and the Jawbone fit comfortably, though the Jawbone is less pliable than the bit bit. The Flex stayed in place, since you could tighten it, the Jawbone slide around some, but not enough to hate it.- They both seem to accurately determine step counts. I did like that the Flex allowed you to tap it to see your progress throughout the day - something that the Jawbone lacks.- They are both easy to put into sleep mode, either by the app on your phone or by tapping multiple times (Flex) or holding in a button (Jawbone).- Overall, they are both quality products. The Jawbone, in my opinion, is more stylish than the Flex, but the Flex isn't awful to look at.- So, all things considered...it came down to the app. The Jawbone app was more visually appealing and had more features than the Flex (power nap, reminders, Smart Alarm, and Idle Alert). The Flex gave you a better track on your daily goals. They both do well with integrating into MyFitnessPal, but the Flex gives you a better representation of how you are doing with calories in vs. out, your goal weight, and your water intake...all things the Jawbone app lacks. The visual appearance and overall feature of the reminders and idle alerts are what got me to like Jawbone more.In either case, you're getting a good product.

I don't see the need for any additional (distracting IMO) features like text messaging alerts and caller ID. It tracks activity, sleep patterns, active minutes, syncs wirelessly and you can use the Fitbit App or log in online.2. After wearing my Flex continually for about 2 months, I found that Flex design is a better choice for people like me. I am clumsy and often bump into objects with my wrist.

To turn on you open your app and basically turn on sleep mode. From that point on the flex tracks your sleep through movement and records your sleep time, restlessness and awake time by the minute. When you wake to start to your day you open the app and turn sleep mode off. It then creates a graph that visual measures your sleep time and shows you in minutes by colors the times you sleep soundly, we're restless or awake. If you wake during the night and walk around or get a snack you still leave your flex on sleep mode. This way you can have a better representation of your sleep patterns. From the website I was able to print off daily and weekly sleep charts to share with my doctors to try to improve my sleeping habits.I enjoyed seeing the number of steps i was taking each time I would sync my flex and how many miles I walked each day. I found myself walking more to see if I could beat the previous days total or to round off miles for the day . The flex also gives you a estimate of how many calories you burn as we'll. You can enter additional activities in the log such as exercising or mowing the grass to make the estimated calories burned more accurate. You can also add food to a log to keep a caloric count of you day. If your exact food does not appear on the preselected list you can manual add everything. A lot of common fast food is already on the list.The battery lasts for about four to five days but charges quickly. The downside is there is no heart rate or blood pressure monitor and you must manual turn your flex to sleep mode. But the band is decently comfortable and does not irritate my sensitive skin. It's also water resistant, easy to clean and looks like a simple wrist band.

Water collects in the resovoir where the Fitbit is lodged. When you remove the Fitbit to clear the water, you run the risk of tearing the bracelet at the point where it connects to the LED display window, which unfortunately I've done. Also, the skin becomes irritated/rash-like at the point where the Fitbit is against the skin. This has seemed to improve since I've stopped wearing it in the shower.Update: 7/26/13I went walking on a Google Map one-mile, round trip route. The Fitbit Flex recorded the walk accurately. I'm guessing that the issue then when using an elliptical machine, or running in general, may have to do with one's personal stride. I also forgot to mention that the Fitbit Flex does not sync with the HTC One X, despite the Android phone's NFC and Bluetooth capabilities. Hopefully the support for this phone will be added soon.I have had the Fitbit Flex for almost a month now and it's fantastic! It's really a product of the future (I suppose we're there now). I've found it to be a great way to stay informed of one's overall activity and general health. While some aspects of one's health may be beyond their control (genetics), this device allows you to maintain those aspects that are within one's ability to maintain.I love the Fitbit Flex because it's literally a constant reminder on your wrist. The two size bracelets are great with varying adjustment clasps. I generally adjust it tighter for activities such as sports and running, while loosening it slightly for daily use. I've read other reviews and some appear to have had issues with the bracelet, however I think that the design is fantastic. It's adjustable, so you're not stuck with a size that is uncomfortable. I also like the way that the bracelet \"clicks\" when it is secured, this way you're certain not to lose it. I've played beach volley ball, football, and also went into the ocean (accidentally) with the Fitbit Flex and it's still on my wrist! Sometimes, I forget that it's there, as it's so light and unobtrusive. It's become such a part of my routine. The battery life is great (five days) and the sleep tracker provides wonderful insight. The accompanying software, graphs, etc. make it really easy to track one's progress. It's also great that it integrates with third party apps like myfitnesspal.com, which displays calorie intake verses activity.It's a great product for anyone attempting to get into shape. If you're already active, you'll absolutely love this device as it provides in-depth analysis into one's goals. I also purchased the Aria scale, which combined with all of the Fitbit software, just provides greater analysis. In the three weeks that I've had the Fitbit Flex, I've lost five pounds! This goes back to it being a constant reminder on your wrist and my running on days that I normally would have taken off (but I want to reach that distance goal). I have a friend who has a Fitbit One and so we have a friendly step competition, which also helps in staying active.This product would be five stars if I could be certain about it's distance accuracy. I generally run on an elliptical machine, which displays my run as four miles. The Fitbit Flex usually credits me with running 3.5 miles. I am planning walking one mile via a Google Map route from my home, to gauge the Fitbit's accuracy.Overall, a fantastic product!", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QVBKFT55D97S?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Fantastic!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2018-05-21", "review_body": "I didn't like this Fitbit.

I did every step recommended on the troubleshoot website, and no results.  I've contacted Fitbit twice and have gotten no response.  I can't in good conscience recommend the product, because of the product itself as well as the customer service.  I bought this because I heard the customer service was great.  That does not seem to be the case on my end.  I wanted to love this item, but if I can't get it replaced or something, I will have to lower the review to even just one start.

I was interested in- Steps taken- Distance travelled- Active minutes- Calories burnedHow accurate is this data? Read on to find out, but although the quality of the data is iffy, the Fitbit is a fantastic tool for keeping active.  On other issues like setup, sleep anaylsis, web interface and the iOS app (after the latest update), the Fitbit rates very highly.-- Steps takenI tested the step accuracy by walking for 15 minutes, using the GPS in a Garmin to measure distance, and a clicker to count the steps.  The Fitbit recorded 1,059 steps, and 0.6 miles, while the clicker gave me 1,707 steps and the GPS claimed 0.91 miles.  These numbers show that the Fitbit data is about 60% of the actual data. This is a huge difference!!!  I have repeated this test with similar results; in all cases, the number of steps was at most 70% of the actual numbers.  I have learned to live with this lack of accuracy by modifying the number of daily steps in my goals; instead of 10,000 steps, I aim for 7,000 steps.How about the number of steps if you log an activity? Below is data for some activities: - Vinyasa Yoga (1 hour): 68 steps - Rowing at 150 watts (15 minutes): 230 steps - Body Pump (1 hour): Varies between 774 and 942. - Cycling at 15-16 mph  (1 hour): 3,927 steps - Cycling at 16+ mph  (1 hour): 2,750 stepsIf you equate steps with effort, then these numbers are low (compare them to walking for 1 hour). But this is intrinsic to any device that measures effort via arm movements. You just need to adjust your goals, not a big deal.-- Distance travelledThe Fitbit measures distance by multiplying the number of steps by the stride length; if you have not set a stride length in your profile, Fitbit derives one from your age and height. Once I realized this, I lost interest in distance (I can multiply numbers).-- Active minutesThe only way that I could get Fitbit to credit me with active minutes was by logging an activity. Otherwise Fitbit is stingy with active minutes. For example, today I did more than 10,000 steps but only got 2 active minutes. Sigh!-- Calories burnedWhat is a calorie? Seems to depend on the person, heart rate profile, and body efficiency.  Estimates from heart monitors and other devices vary by huge amounts, so I use them to indicate trends.  Below are the numbers from some activities as measured by Fitbit and the data from the HealthStatus site - Vinyasa Yoga (1 hour): 434 calories, HealthStatus 574 calories - Rowing at 150 watts (15 minutes): 127 calories, HealthStatus 142 calories - Body Pump (1 hour):  357 calories, HealthStatus 400 calories - Cycling at 15-16 mph  (1 hour): 601 calories, HealthStatus 696 caloriesIt looks like Fitbit consistently gives lower numbers than HealthStatus so you can use this information to adjust the number of calories burned to stay at your weight (or whatever).  HealthStatus claims that 2128 calories is the right number for a moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) man of my age and weight, so I am using 2300 as my goal; I may revise if my weight starts changing.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BUG906LWVHUW?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Amazing and addictive but accuracy is an issue"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2013-08-03", "review_body": "Many of my online friends have Fitbits of several varieties. We had been supporting each other in our weight loss and health goals for years, and this seemed like a fun tool to help us do it.  I glanced at descriptions of Fitbit products, and considered the comments my friends had made (seems like everyone had lost or washed their Fitbit at least once), I decided that a water resistant band you wore 24/7 was the style for me. It is comfortable, not unattractive - I suppose most people assume it is just one of those rubber bracelets so many wear these days or some weird watch.  The first time I put it on was a bit of a struggle, in fact, it recorded that I burned 54 calories just getting it on, lol.  It isn't as difficult now that it's been done a few times.  It's only come off by accident once:  I was struggling with my 110 lb. dog's collar and leash, trying to get her away from the chickens and back in the house.  I had the leash wrapped around my wrist, and in the confusion, it came off.  The good thing was, since it is a rubber bracelet, as soon as I got the leash of my wrist, I felt the cool air on my damp wrist where the bracelet had been and knew it was gone - I found it immediately!I lost 10lbs. in the first 7 days I owned the Flex, just using the dashboard to log my foods (count calories), and trying to meet my steps and activity goals.  Pretty shocking.  I've slowed down since then, as expected, but I am still very enthusiastic about the benefits of owning a Fitbit to encourage your journey to a healthier lifestyle.Why did I give only 4 stars? Well frankly, because I think the Flex could be better.  I know it's a tiny little capsule-like device, shoved into a bracelet holder, but I bet they could have figured out a way to put some sort of display on it.  Unless you have one of the few smart phones that will actually sync with the flex, the only clues you get to how you are doing are little ambiguously flashing lights, and even if you have the right phone, who wants to stop in the middle of working out to turn on their phone, open an app, and wait for it to sync?  I was so frustrated the first few days I had the Flex, I nearly sent it back.  How close was I to 10,000 steps? All it would tell me is 0-20,21-40,41-60,61-80, or 81-100% towards my goal.  Picture this: 8pm, my Flex shows 4 lights. Am I nearly 4000 steps away from my goal so I should just forget it, or am I just a quick walk down the street away? I think all the other Fitbit devices have numeric displays, the Flex only communicates through flashing dots and vibrations.After a few weeks of use, I still have a little \"display\" envy, but am satisfied with my purchase.  Long battery life, easy to wear, being able to wear it in the shower or swimming, and the fact it isn't easy to lose, are all virtues that help me squash that jealous feeling and remember to love my Flex :)", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JJ6BZPX5XRNA?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Enjoy but could be better"}], [{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-08-01", "review_body": "This is the most disappointing purchase I have ever made on Amazon and shows why you should always read ALL the negative reviews first and decide whether to buy.

I think the Fitbit Flex gets a lot of things right, but I am sorely disappointed with the build quality. I will say, though, the customer support has been excellent.I've had this only 7 months and I'm already on my third silicone band. The first one developed an unsightly bulge (took about 3 months)  around where the fitbit actually sits in the wrist band, which also caused the fitbit to feel insecure in the band. The company sent a replacement free of charge that clearly feels heavier/sturdier like the silicone is more rigid. I think that extra rigidity caused the second failure. That replacement band separated from the plastic window (where the little white LEDs are visible) in less than two months. Guess they need stronger glue. Again, this was replaced free of charge to me. I'm on my third band now and so far, so good. I'm not hard on this thing--I just wear it as intended. Although it is shower safe, I always take it off anyway. Someone who might be harder or more demanding may find the quality issues more problematic.Unfortunately, the band isn't the only thing that is poorly built. The fitbit \"bean\" that fits into the band needs charged and a USB charging dock/dongle is included for this purpose. This little USB dock/dongle is clearly failing as well--when I plug it in, I have to play around with the positioning of the charging device to get it to actually charge. It is only a matter of time until this piece completely fails. I'll be contacting customer service to hopefully get this replaced because without it, the fitbit will be completely useless.Other than the mediocre built quality, I do enjoy the features.

It does what it says, idiot-proof UI on the bracelet.  Five stars for the hardware.Cons:The Android app and the website are the most atrocious works of good idea fairy teamwork I've seen in a long time.  It almost feels as though each PM for each little widget was given full admin access to the main design of the site/app and just built whatever they wanted to, with their own idea of what a kick ass website should look/feel like.  There's no centralized settings window for what you want, and there are numerous bugs.  Half of the settings you have to enter on the site, and the other half of the settings you have to enter through the app.  I didn't think it was possible to build such a poorly designed website that is still so functional.  Going further- if you want to add a friend, you have to use their email address the registered to their fitbit account.  And if you want to add your new friend to a group, you have to again use their email, which is not available data to you as the end user.  The actual usefulness of the dashboard page is thoughtfully done, except the complete wanton regard for settings.Pros:They nailed the privacy area, you can see your page as if you are you, a friend, or a stranger, and control who sees all your data.  You might have to go back and forth through the app and the website to get it all, but it's not that bad.  Try configuring your food/diet plan though, and I have to go for a run to burn off the angst it creates.  Perhaps that's by design?Bigger Pro:It's just the website, and that can be easily changed.  Fitbit is collecting and protecting all the data they need to keep their product line running, and they've exposed API's to outside devs, so while I hate the Fitbit food entry tool, I can use the MyFitnessPal app/site to do it and it synchs up in real time.  The website feels like a horrible V1.  I expect the site to mature and get better, and they won't need to re-release the tracker hardware, assuming they stop building hardware that burns people, etc.Biggest Pro:Customer Service.  They have a helpdesk that opens individual trouble tickets for you, they are quick to respond, and while their info isn't always completely helpful, they've gotten the job done for me with the two Flex trackers and the Aria I bought.  You can quickly see your open and closed tickets on the site, so long as you can find the page again.  I'll review the Aria soon.  Super cool device, they listened and fixed the pairing problems.

I contacted FitBit Customer Support and after submitting all of the proof and evidence (receipt, pictures, etc.) they wrote me back yesterday that they'll replace it but the bands are on back order and they can give me no date as to when I might receive it. So, as this band continues to break apart, moisture gets into the display and fogs it. When it finishes breaking apart, I'll have to carry the device around in my pocket which defeats the whole purpose of spending 100 bucks on the flex version. If I'd wanted to carry it around, I could have bought a much cheaper version. The customer service I received was unacceptable.

The fitbit is a fine piece of hardware though the battery technology must be two generations old--we really should be able to get a week or more on a single charge.  Probably the best benefit is that it makes you focus on fitness--what you eat and how much you move.The iOS app is average--clearly not a highlight of the fitbit and the iPad version is just a double-sized iPhone app.  It's nice that you can sync up via Bluetooth to get instant readouts but  that doesn't make up for the poor user interface and the difficulty in finding things in the app.  If someone comes along with a comparable fitness monitor but a good iOS app, I'll be making a change immediately because the real value of the fitbit is in the information that you get out of it, and the app is a key interface.The sleep monitor function is the most frustrating part of the fitbit.  Its never clear whether the fitbit is in sleep mode or that you've woken it up in the morning.  When it works, it works fine.  But more than half the time I end up with either 16 hours of sleep (with 9 hours of awake or restlessness) or 0 hours of sleep.

Phone set up was equally simple.  I have a Galaxy Note 2 and the NFC link works great.  Just touch them together and the app opens and syncs data.3.  The software itself is useful and easy.4.

I simply set my alarms on the computer (or phone), sync and go!  No more forgetting to set my alarm.  No more waking up my wife.  My arm vibrates and I wake up.  Nice!!So now we get to the learning curve part.  Certain activities will trick the band fitbit into thinking you are exercising/walking when you are not.  I ride a motorcycle (chopper).  The fit bit mistook the vibration for thousands of steps.  It also went in and out of sleep mode because it thought I was tapping it.

Certainly not me.  I hoped it would but it has proven to be a real boon to my exercise routine.  In the beginning I thought it would just be nice to know how many steps I took in a day and also to see my sleep patterns.  It suggests that you set 10,000 steps as your daily goal so I went with it.  Then I quickly realized how little I was walking to meet that goal so I began walking my dog more, finding more reasons to walk places, etc.  It is now to the point where if I don't get my 10,000 steps every day I am disappointed!  This little band makes me so aware of how much (or little) I walk each day that if I now find that it is \"almost\" to my goal, I will find ways to get those last steps in so that I can pat myself on the back for doing more to get in shape.  Now, it's not as if I didn't know I was out of shape to begin with; anyone who looked at me could tell that.

I like the concept of the product, and the website is easy to use. They're not 100% accurate, but the food and sleep tracking features are also great. The device doesn't count all your steps sometimes, but I've found when I put the tracker in my shoe while on the treadmill, it's very accurate.However, Fitbit's customer service is horrendous.I had a syncing issue with my device, and it was syncing intermittently but not when I was prompting it to sync. At the time I was using it as my main alarm clock, but I wasn't waking up at the same time each morning and needed to change the alarm nightly before going to sleep.I emailed them after following the steps in the help section of their website. I'm the type of person that does all the suggested fixes, and searches for answers online before contacting customer care.When you file a help ticket, their website instructs you to fill out a form with details like your issue, the type of computer you're using, and your device, etc.The person who answered my query sent me instruction for a PC and told me to check if I was behind a firewall. When I pointed out that I was a Mac user (as per the form they made me fill out), they replied politely, but still didn't give me a useable suggestion...because they took so long to reply that the Fitbit started to sync again by itself. They basically replied that a sync happened at X time, and I should let them know if it still wouldn't sync and if I needed further assistance.I mentioned in my help ticket that my device was having syncing issue all of that week...it's as if they completely disregarded all the information I sent in, and they were answering the parts they deemed fit.My next issue is the bands. I've bought 2 replacement bands since I've had my device, the first replacement within 2 months, and second within another 2 months...2 replacement bands in 4 months suggest the quality of the bands are poor. I've had watches last me for years, and I have a bracelet on my dominant hand that I've worn without problems for the past 5 years. I think I can take care of items meant to be worn on my hand...especially a device I wear on my non-dominant hand, that I do not shower with (even though it says you can shower with it on).Now, I only use the device to measure my steps when I workout, and occasionally as an alarm or to measure my sleep.

The time I spend on the elliptical exerciser at the gym apparently gets counted, I'm happy to say. The feedback on sleep is interesting and may be helpful.  It does detect restlessness at night and it detects that you are awake if you actually get out of bed, but it does not detect wakefulness if you are lying quietly in bed.  Even though it is not 100% accurate on sleep, it is useful to get some feedback on duration and quality of sleep.  It took a couple of days to learn just how many times to tap to turn the sleep counter on and off, and sometimes I forget to turn it off which messes up the record.

I think it has some pros and cons, and could be useful if it fits one's needs.  I think it's probably good for people who want to know how much activity they're getting in their daily routine, but it's not a comprehensive tracking tool for athletes.Pros:1.  It's fun to use.  I have 3 young kids and run a few half marathons a year, so it's no surprise that my Fitbit tells me I'm very active.  I like having the LED display show me how close I am to my daily goal.  It syncs easily with my old iphone 4s.  After putting the Fitbit on and taking it off a few times, the wristband seemed to soften up a little and become easier to latch, so don't get discouraged if it seems to hard to clasp at first.2.  The sleep tracker is a nice feature.3.  Having a goal can be an effective motivator.  I can see how the Fitbit would make people want to move more to reach their step count goal.Cons:1.  Could be misleading about how much real activity you are getting.  I have days when I don't exercise at all, but take over 10,000 steps because I'm chasing after my kids, running errands, going up and down stairs doing laundry, etc..  According to the Fitbit, 10,000 steps is about the equivalent of running or walking 5 miles.  However, taking 10,000 steps while going about my daily routine is not the same -- in terms of calories burned or health benefits -- as running or walking 5 miles straight.  I can see how this device would make some people think they are moving and burning more calories than they really are.2.  Battery life.  The battery is supposed to last 5 days after a full charge.  I've been using my Fitbit for about a week, and a charge only seems to last me 2 or 3 days.  Then it can take hours to recharge fully.  And it doesn't track activity while it's charging.  This detail doesn't bother me, but for people who are really serious about tracking each and every step all day, it could be an issue.3.  My device goes into sleep mode every time I push a grocery cart.  Not a big deal to me, but I can see how this would be annoying to other folks.4.  Doesn't \"do it all\" for runners.  The Fitbit can track time spent running and calculate calories burned.  I understand it can also make announcements while you're running with distance, time, splits, etc., although I haven't tried that feature.  However, I still use my iphone while running for music, GPS, and logging my runs.  I don't think the Fitbit is intended to replace an iphone, so this is not so much a criticism as information about what it does -- and doesn't do -- for runners.Overall, I think the Fitbit is a fun little toy.  It's not life-changing -- at least for me -- but I appreciate what it can do.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9E155JZO6OLK?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Nice toy, good for tracking daily activity, not so great for tracking runs"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2013-12-19", "review_body": "I received my Fitbit Flex two days ago after first discovering an app called Pedometer on my iPhone..Since I liked Pedometer so much, I felt it might be beneficial to try a dedicated activity tracker and ordered a Pulse by Withings.The pulse is great but the Flex has some advantages that looked interesting and worthwhile. Firstly, the ability to always have it on you as opposed to remembering to bring the Pulse with you. It also has a great alarm that wakes you with gentle vibrations.The software with the Fitbit Flex is better than the Pulse..It syncs easily and the whole experience is more in depth and well..just better.I've been wearing the Flex for two days and I took them out today and did a formal comparison, mostly concerned with accuracy to the amount of steps and distance traveled.The walk I did I know to be a bit over one mile yet the Flex recorded it as about half a mile.. That's a big difference, so much as to render the Flex useless in this capacity.The amount of steps was about 10% greater on the Flex as compared to the Pulse.But wearing the flex in the house, which was a big draw to having a tracker on all day turned out to be useless. I changed the dominant hand to right as Fitbit suggests wearing it on the non dominant wrist..I am right handed.The differences in recorded steps in my apartment compared to the Pulse was stark. The Pulse was right on accurate, The Flex was laughably inaccurately..It recorded about 300 steps in my small bathroom while shaving.To me this means that the only way to really use such an inaccurate tracker might be only for dedicated walks and excersize...that would require turning it off at other times.I'm surprised how inaccurate this product is and am going to return it.It's a shame as there is so much good about this product but anyone using it will be in for a rude awakening to see that the total real steps taken in a given day might be off by 100%.I'll read up to see what I could have been doing wrong but as said, it doesn't seem to be anywhere near accurate to wear in the home and the distance traveled was so way off.Requesting an RA tonight.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OC4DARDUUH8G?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Almost Great."}], [{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-02-02", "review_body": "I wish I had waited for the Force, as I go up and down flights of stairs all the time, so that is my number one specific complaint about the Flex because it doesn't track stairs climbed.As for everything else...The key to the Fitbit products lies in the software used to track everything. Unfortunately, unlike some others, it doesn't have a heart rate monitor, so any exercise has to be manually logged. For someone like me who does HIIT and heavy weight lifting, I don't feel that the metabolic rate calculated for me before exercise is incredibly accurate, even without a workout, my metabolism would allow me to eat more than a mere 1450 calories a day, so the software is shaky at best. For the average person, however, who might just need a visual of their daily activity versus caloric intake, products like fitness wristbands and trackers can be such a great tool. I got the Fitbit, maybe someday I'll get a Polar with a heart rate monitor, but I don't feel like I need anything more at this particular moment. I am obsessed with my Fitbit and logging my food and I LOVE that the software calculates the ratio of Carbs:Fats:Proteins for you and displays it, because that is so important for people to be aware of when planning their food, even more so than just calories sometimes.About 6 weeks after I got my first one, it stopped charging. Even though it's water proof, if you look on the tracker at eh bottom where the connection is made to the charger, gunk can sometimes get in there and prevent it from charging. This soon led to a defective device, so I contacted Fitbit. Even though I purchased it through Amazon, as it said in the invoice I emailed to them, Fitbit sent me a brand new device with 2-day shipping free of charge, no questions asked, no hoops to jump through. Their customer service is great. From now on, when I take my showers, I leave the little tracker in the charger, so the little daily charge keeps it going and I don't risk the junk build up, and I don't like showering with anything on my wrists anyway.The Fitbit Flex does not provide the most extensive analysis of your activity/metabolism, but I was writing everything in a food journal, using Myfitnesspal.com to track calories and calculating my physical activity on varied calculators online to make sure I stayed on track. So the Fitbit for me really simplified things, and I can also log things on the go from my phone. For a fitness instructor like me, or any serious athlete, I would recommend something that has a heart rate monitor and a better grasp on an individual's BMR. For anyone simply wanting to become more involved with their daily choices and have a better grasp of what they need to maintain a healthy balance, this is a great tool because it's simple, portable, and convenient. Very handy little device, I'd get a Force if I could do it all over, but I am happy for the time being with my Fitbit products.I am a cycling and TRX instructor, as well as an avid power lifter, and of course, I am obsessed with Bikram yoga. I do at least 60 minutes of intense cardiovascular training a day, 6 days a week, and weight train 4-5 days a week. In my opinion, the activity tracking portion is the weakest part of the whole product package, but it's nothing that can't be worked around, and the program allows customized activities be created for those who know how to calculate and factor in their various activities.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3896OSGYBHP2W?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Fitbit Flex, Perfect?

You can only make one sleep entry and you can not edit a sleep event. Once you set a sleep log you cant go back and modify it or change it in any way. Occasionally I have to get up in the middle of the night to work on international projects. I may get up and 2 and go back to bed at 4. It does not allow you to do this.3.

I take the stairs up 8 flights every day and it never shows any of that activity.

You would normally put it into sleep mode by tapping on it four of five times after getting into bed.  I work in retail and there is something about pushing shopping carts from the lot to the store that puts this thing in sleep mode nearly every time.  No problem if you notice it right away (it vibrates when it changes modes but my hands are vibrating quite a bit when pushing carts and I often don't notice the change in modes) but if you don't you'll lose hours of tracking time while the fitbit thinks you're having one heckuva restless sleep.

I didn't cry. For one thing, the reason it fell off is because it is very difficult to fasten. If you have a bit of arthritis in your hands, like I do, you won't like this difficulty, and eventually your Fitbit, not quite firmly fastened, will fall off too. The Fitbit software is clever and well-designed, and for a few weeks it's fun to track things like sleep. Once you figure out your sleep pattern, however, you won't care any more. The step tracking is the best part and a good motivator if you need that. Even so, your step patterns will become quite predictable depending on the day of the week and your routine. Alas, other activities don't register well or even at all: gardening, yoga, riding a stationary bike, and so on. It's possible to enter some of these manually, but it's an imperfect science. As for swimming, forget it; you should take it off to swim, and then you're back to the fastening difficulty. I don't count calories or water intake, so I never tracked that. As advertised, the device can be worn in the shower, but there is the potential for skin irritation if you wear it all of the time. Is Fitbit worth the money? If you're still interested but don't want to stick with a simple pedometer, start with the cheapest Fitbit.

The battery life was great, about 5 days or so between charges, and I never had an issue with the unit.Then everything went downhill.  I first started noticing problems when I had a hard time getting the unit to charge.  I had to forcefully place it in the charge cable and I had to stand the charge cable upright because the unit would fall out of it or lose contact with the connectors.  This went on for a couple months and then all of a sudden the unit would not charge at all.  I tried cleaning the connectors like Fitbit had recommended and that did not work either.Luckily for me I found a customer service phone number online(they don't publish a support phone number anywhere on the packaging or their website) and they sent me a new unit.  The customer service person was very polite and apologized for the defective unit and gladly sent me a new one.Also, my wife bought one of these a couple months after me and she just started having the same problems about a month ago.  First the lights on the front of hers were going in and out and then she had the same charging issues.  Just this week hers has stopped charging all together and we are going to have to call and get hers replaced as well.To sum it up, I love the Fitbit Flex when it works.

I really love the app and the function on the device. However, I believe the quality of these devices is worth considering. Fitbit suggests that the device can be worn in the water. I do not recommend it. I remove it before showering, swimming and try to avoid getting it wet. I have seen other reviews stating that the device died after using it in water. Plus you'll want to make sure the internal pocket of the bracelet is kept dry to avoid mold. I've had to replace a my bracelet to prevent this issue - and it's expensive to replace it more than once.Accuracy is not a strong feature of fitbit. It you choose to wear it during step aerobics, zumba, and the like. It does not accurately track your steps. The additonal arm movements some how change the responsiveness of the device. I have a few workout videos that are labled as 1, 2, 3 mile workouts. Although I believe it is true the workouts are always this exact milage. I could do the same workout on 3 different days and get 3 - vastly - different results using the fitbit. Same with cycling. Although the fitbit isnt suggested for cycling activity since I wear it all the time I was curious of the response. One day it tracked about 1/3 of my ride. The next time none of my ride was tracked. I dont care if it tracks it or not - I just want it to be more accurate and consistent.I have to factory reset the device often to keep it functional.Overall I am disappointed that a $100 device that is intended to be worn all the time doesnt have much stamina.

Also helps with gauging sleep quality. It is an accelerometer that simply measures body movements. However, it is very well designed. First it is sleek and unobtrusive. Secondly it is accurate.

The charge lasts about 5 days and change. Recharge is fairly quick (a couple of hours). The little leds on the wrist tell you what percentage of the goal you have reached. It does chafe a little if you wear it non-stop for days but it is really minimal (less than a plastic watch).The controls are simple. Double-tap is see progress, rapidly tap it to put it in and out of sleep mode (where it does note smaller movements) and that is it.It syncs either by connecting to your computer after you setup the software. Or by using the included wireless adapter included to be plugged into your computer (about 15-20 foot range). Or by using the free iPhone App. You set your goal either through the iPhone or the Web interface along with setting details, recording body changes, personal physical details for calorie estimation, and a whole slew of sleep, activity, etc., charts and graphs to appeal to those that such things appeal to.

Having used pedometers and heart rate monitors myself, I was interested to see how this was different and how he'd use it. I was initially skeptical that it was little more than a glorified pedometer. The more he used it, the more intrigued I was, until I convinced him to let me borrow it for a week.After testing it out, I am asking for one for my next gift-receiving occasion. The Flex is much better than any pedometer I've ever used. It does over-count steps a bit (especially if you wear it on your dominant hand), but I really like the bracelet-style design, so  that's a small drawback. I love that I don't have to think about catching it on my bag (as I would with something fixed to my belt or pants) or having it fall out of my pocket. It's very lightweight and after a day or two I forgot I was wearing it. I prefer the Flex to the Force because of this - I think the Force looks a little clunky for my taste. The Flex certainly isn't high fashion, but it's modern looking and just inconspicuous enough that it doesn't bother me.As for how it compares to a heart-rate monitor: they really are not comparable, but if I had to choose one, I would pick the Flex. I used a heart rate monitor in different, more fitness-focused stages of my life, and it's a great tool for measuring your fitness gains. However, they can be pretty involved, and I still never got comfortable wearing a chest-strap to yoga.The Flex is an awesome tool for tracking steps you take in day-to-day life, which is a pretty good proxy of activity for my husband and I. It may not be adequate for someone looking for more intense fitness tracking (or someone who bikes a lot) Living in a city with a sedentary office job, the amount we each walk in a day varies a lot. The Flex is both a great reminder, tracker, and motivator. The app has a great interface, which is both easy enough to use regularly and involved enough to be helpful and interesting.

I was the only one who ordered mine from Amazon out of the 10 people in my family who have one, and mine failed after one month of use. It happened after doing the dishes, my tracker was non responsive and there was condensation inside of the top of the tracker where it says fitbit. Afterwards I finally got it to charge, but it would only last for 20 minutes but would not track any movement. I contacted Fitbit and conversed with them about the problem. After they concluded that it was not user error I sent them a screen shot of my order form from Amazon and they sent me a new one. Very helpful customer service. But it was still annoying since one of Fitbits main attractions is that it can get wet. I will see if this one holds up better.This is by far the best, and most comfortable tracker that I have had. I had the Nike tracker for a while but it was uncomfortable and not as stylish as the Fitbit, which fits perfectly around my wrist. Very accurate step counter as well as sleep tracker.

I'm not sure what the charge value requirements are but I think I had it plugged into a legacy USB 1.0 hub, it appeared to charge but wouldn't wake up when I removed it from the device, and would only sync while attached to USB.After a SUNDAY email to fitbit, I got a reply back from Support Analyst 'Ana B' that very evening (!!!) about the reset process that involved the charging dongle. Upon reset, it lit right up, and it occurred to me I may have charged it from a legacy USB hub. I plugged into a known good USB 2.0 port and gave it a few hours and its back to it's full glory. (It probably didn't need that long.)Ana B. at Fitbit support, you're wonderful!What I like most about it:Syncs with Android Bluetooth 4.0 devices wirelessly, and needs NO PC setup unless you want it. My household PCs are all linux, and I hate being told to use windows for something that should be 100% percent wireless. THIS FITS THE BILL!Does the sleep logging; I work 3rds and am night owl so keeping on top of my sleep is vital, and the android scheduling tool handles my weird sleep schedule perfectly.Software app: Very robust, great food catalogue that you can modify as needed, this is a huge bonus for my particular goal and is low-carb friendly in the sense that it gives pretty accurate counts and listings.Wristband - 2 bands in your color choice come with the flex, a larger size for guys and a smaller one for women. I wear the wrist band upside down, and it looks very subtle, like any other livestrong - style wristband. Even right side up on my wrist it's very unobstrusive and not bulky.Durability, So far I've gotten it submerged in water 3 times while gardening, so issues.Things to be aware of --- Bracelet Fastener is small and could be lost, keep track of it-- tracker itself if you get \"black\" is small and potentially hard to find if you remove from wristband, keep it with its charger if you need to clean the wristband separately for any reason.- If you are an Android 'Custom Rom user', confirm your ROM has enabled Bluetooth 4 if your device supports it, this was once an issue for me on my previous device.I can happily endorse this the Flex as it makes getting out to exercise much easier to track and not have to worry, \"Where did I leave my pedometer THIS time?\"", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F68DDHJ6XQH9?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "First thing to know about Fitbit devices is support is AWESOME, Flex is even better."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-06-01", "review_body": "Item received as described in a factory fresh sealed package but didn't work .

Overall, I like this one better.  I like that I don't see the actual step count (since I get a little neurotic when I pay too close attention to it)...just the little lights that approximate how close I am to my goal.  However, I had gotten in the habit of using the Zip for a timepiece, and I keep looking at this one (which is where a watch would be if I was wearing one) and then remembering it doesn't tell time.  The sleep tracker function is interesting, but I don't really know that it's earth-shattering or even particularly useful information to know that I sleep better some nights than others.  But the big difference is that this one is so much more sensitive (i.e. inaccurate) compared to the Zip.  I'd say it overestimated my steps by as much as 15% or even 20%.  I usually struggled to get to 10,000 steps a day with the Zip, but I was registering all kinds of steps with the Flex.  (My husband attributes this partly to the fact that I talk with my hands, which I'm sure is part of the problem.)  I followed the trouble-shooting advice and set the tracker for \"dominant hand\" but wear it on my non-dominant hand.  This is supposed to be one way to adjust the tracker to make it less sensitive to movements that aren't actually steps.  I think it still may be a little off, but not nearly as much as when I was first using it.  Compared to the Zip, the Flex just seems to sense movement in general instead of only steps.  When we ski, my Flex registers steps while my husband's Zip doesn't...although we don't have exactly the same form, so that may add to the discrepancy.

I use My Fitness Pal to track my food and it syncs with the fit bit flex so i am able to really keep track of calories. I will admit, when I first got it, it took about a week to get used to. Here's a tip:  if you set your MFP profile to sedentary or active or whatever, make sure your fit bit is set the same so that the calories count is more accurate. No matter what, MFP and Fit Bit are always about 50 calories off each other in regards to how many I have left for the day. Also, Fit Bit projects how many calories you will burn in a day based on your activity level, height, age and weight and you work down, if that makes sense. So sometimes, I may show I have 500 calories left based on what I am projected to burn, but then I may take a nap in the afternoon on a weekend and not burn as many as I usually do. So the next day when I look at my progress from the day before, it may say I ate 50-100 calories over when at the time of me eating it told me I had enough calories. The thing to remember is that this is a tool to help. Not a 100% accurate count of calories, though it is pretty darn close. Also, I look at it like a game. Each morning I wake up to see how many calories I burned and find out if I \"won the game\" of making to my 750 calorie deficit. So far after one month of using Fit Bit, tracking eating calories in MFP and walking about 30 minutes four days a week, I have lost about 6 pounds. (I loathe working out and never stick to it, but found that I really enjoy walking.)  I love being able to check my progress throughout the day and see that my walk into work burned 60 calories, or my errand to another building on campus burned 100. It really is a great motivator.

I work at a desk 40-hours a week. Not a week after I had it, the wristband started looking worn and is no longer black, but a grey that won't come clean. The smooth texture actually started becoming a bit rough like something was eating away at it. Adding to that, yes this is safe to wear in the shower, BUT the wristband does collect water, so you should probably remove the tracker every once in a while to dry out the inside of the band.My other complaint is that the method of tapping to interact with the band to either put it in sleep mode or turn off an alarm isn't so great. Fitbit says to tap twice to acknowledge an alarm, or 5 times to start/stop sleep mode, but I usually find myself tapping repeatedly until it does something.With that being said, those two complaints do make me not like the device as much as I wanted to, but with all the other insight it's given me as to my activity, I still choose to wear it every day.

Fitbit really dropped the ball on this device considering the features offered on their other devices. Here is why:-it doesn't count stairs-no data is displayed on the device except some flashing lights-useless enough they might as well have given the device no visible data-accuracy of step counting not as accurate  as the One ( this may be a trend for Fitbit as the accuracy of the One is not  as good as the Ultra).-no trigger when inactive for a period of time-difficult to fasten-takes up two USB ports on the computer: one for the charger and one for the dongle-takes a long time to charge, even if not fully depletedI assume the absence of basic functions available on the other devices  must be a marketing ploy by Fitbit since this item costs the same as the other Fitbits without the functionality of those devices.There are a few things I like:-no need to find a place to attach it to clothing-somewhat waterproof (I have not tested this feature)-ability to change out the bands to different colors-not unattractive to wear,even with dress clothes and other jewelry-comfortable and unobtrusive-I often forget I am wearing itBecause of the paucity of data it provides, and because none of it is available from looking directly at the device, I am still wearing my other Fitbit as well. Aside from the inconvenience of wearing two devices This creates more work as you can not have more than one device per account/email address. If you want all the data in one place you have to manually enter it under one account or the other. Sheesh!I have read reviews that say it over counts, and counts things like driving as steps. I have not had this problem; in fact mine seems to under count. I am wearing it on my nondominant arm. Reviews have complained about the short battery life, listed in the manual as approximately 5 days. I have charged mine at 5-6 days and it always has 4 bars (5 is the max). It does take a LONG time to charge though,and the manual warns of this: to charge from 4 bars to 5 takes well over an hour. I am not using the sleep function and Bluetooth data to my phone about 3-4 times most days which may help explain my longer battery life.While there are a couple of nice things about this device it is WAY overpriced for what it offers. It seems Fitbit created this more as a novelty than as a useful device like the original, Ultra, and One.

Since I spent time troubleshooting the jawbone and for the life of me and the assistance I got I never got it to work I decided to just flat out switch to another product. This gave me a means to stack the FitBit Flex against the Jawbone Up (v2).There happens to be a lot of reviews here already comparing the two but I just wanted to give my two cents on the areas of difference that I noticed from personal experience.FitBit Flex doesn't seem to be as accurate in steps tracking as the Jawbone Up for me, maybe not others. But lets say I am on riding a regular John Deer Lawnmower and spending 3+ hrs on it mowing our office property. The time spent turning the wheel and everything has been tracked as steps taken. I go from 6,000 steps before I start to over 10,000 steps, and I know for sure I didn't push mow this place... there may be some tweaking that I need to do, but in general the basic setup that it has you do didn't stop this from happening 3x so far. Otherwise it does detect me driving and does an ok job with I am actually push mowing my own lawn. Just in comparison to the aspect that they makers say they test these devices extensively and \"it knows\" when you are stepping or otherwise, may be accurate but not in my case nor the basic setup of the device.The other thing I have noticed in comparison is that the software is not as polished in some areas as the Jawbone Up was, but in some others areas it is better. It kind of depends on what you are wanting out of the stats. One area that it lacks and it has been mentioned previous to me is the Sleeping Feature.It just tells you how long you slept and doesn't know or tell you \"deep (rem) sleep\" vs \"light sleep\" it just tells you how long you were in deep sleep and the rest is how many times you were awake or active which is a combination of being in light sleep or actually tossing and turning and waking up. The data I do believe is there from the device for the software to determine more accurately, so maybe that is something that will be fixed in future releases of the software or maybe a combination with a firmware update.Functionality, and looks of the device I think is better. The Jawbone Up always get caught on something as I am getting dressed or otherwise, where the Flex is more like a watch and it better when you are typing on a keyboard or otherwise have your wrists laying flat on a desk, it feels more natural with the Flex.I like the indicator lights in comparison to really nothing other than one light that gives you different indications depending on what you have done to make it interact with you.I am still torn between the two for features, but as of right now I am keeping the FitBit Flex and will just await updates on features and upgrades. For tracking my sleep better I may have to look at a little more feature rich device as it is cause if anyone asks my wife she thinks I have some issues with trying to sleep or staying asleep as it is.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HMTE0LTAK0S2?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "FitBit Flex, not for everyone but is a great product!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-08-05", "review_body": "I had another fitbit and absolutely loved it.

I give it two stars because there is one function that I really like: silent vibrating alarm, and it's implemented almost poorly, so not great for my favorite feature.1) Band fell apart. The band early on started separating at the joint where the LED lights show through. After a while it just fell apart. Quite upset, new band kits are $30. Upset.1A) Moisture and goop gets into the well that holds the fitbit device. Never dries unless I take it apart clean it and dry it, taking time from my day.2) Largely useless functionality. The unit only tracks arm (and therefore walking) motion, and has a silent alarm. Everything else you have to manually enter...such as weight, calories eaten, water consumption...everything. Heck that can just be a web site, I don't need a $100 band for that.2A) I originally got this for the sleep tracking, but that feature is very squirrelly...you have to MANUALLY tell it when you are going to bed and waking up. It doesn't use any \"smarts\" to determine that you are alseep. So you have to constantly adjust and input your waking/sleeping times. The phone app is somewhat useful, but if you forget to set it or tell it you're awake, well you're in for a world of work to sort the data out. On top of that, the app can go to the background on your phone and you never see the \"I'm awake\" button until too late.2B) Sleep tracking is just not correlated well...for instance how do I know whether I'm a regular sleep or sensitive sleeper? I just don't know and the app doesn't help explain.3) The fitbit device vibrates when it thinks I did 10,000 steps but sometimes it will vibrate late at night when I am asleep. Huh? why?4) Battery life is OK, but can die quickly...causing you to miss an alarm. Even though the app says it has medium battery life, it can die the next day. Not well calibrated, and no warning at all. Sometimes I've had it die at night and there was not enough juice for the vibrating alarm. Needs some kind of warning, and better battery life calibration with the app.5) The battery charging unit is proprietary. Guaranteed you will  lose it, or leave it at home on your next trip by mistake.. Fitbit should have used standard universal USB connectors.6) The user interface is very poor. For instance you tap it to do something...did it register? did it work? How many taps do I have to give it? I don't know, the lights flashed but what do they mean? Sometimes blink, sometimes vibrate...you need a secret decoder ring to figure out what the heck this device is telling you. This is especially bad for the vibrating alarm...tapping snoozes, and tapping turns off the alarm...when you're half asleep, how many taps did you give it? did you just turn it off? I don't know and the lights are too confusing to tell me especially when I'm asleep.7) If I want to track my walking/energy, now I just use an Android fitness tracker app.The wristband broke and this unit is not going into my drawer of useless junk.

I'll do a comparison of the two for those that are considering one or the other:Build: The Fitbit is a little smaller than the Nike and, at least for me, this is a good thing. The fitting system is a bit more granular, with multiple holes available for all wrist-sizes, as opposed to the Nike which, essentially, gave you 2 choices for whichever band size you happened to order. I'm using the larger black wristband, and it fits perfectly (snug-but-not-too-snug). It doesn't jiggle around when I move (unlike my Nike).Ease of charging: The Nike wins out here, since I could just take it off my wrist and plug into any available USB port, whereas the Fitbit requires you to take the small electronic sensor out of the wristband, insert it into the special adapter provided with the wristband, and then plug into a USB port. I've had one or two issues with plugging into a 2.1A USB port as opposed to a 1A, but generally it charges fine.Ease of syncing: The Fitbit syncs via a USB dongle that plugs into your computer or by Bluetooth to your mobile device (I'm using a Moto X on Android 4.4.3). The dongle seems a little extraneous, but I have one constantly plugged into my home Mac Mini and one in my Macbook Air, so I rarely have reason to turn BT on to sync with my phone or iPad. Syncing occurs pretty quickly and painlessly. The Nike, from what I remember, was also relatively painless, but ONLY could sync with a mobile device unless plugged into the USB port. So, while the Fitbit does inexplicably require a dongle, this dongle makes syncing much more painless.Everyday use: I am a pretty sweaty guy, but neither the Fitbit nor the Nike had any real long-term issues with cleanliness on a daily basis. I wore both in the shower, and this (combined with hand washing during the day) seemed to do the job of cleaning them both. The Nike did have more slots and grooves, and I do remember getting some sunscreen in there one day that was a pain to clean out. As mentioned, the better fit of the Fitbit meant that I didn't really notice it around my wrist as much as I did the Nike, which tended to jiggle around. The Fitbit is also a bit flatter, which meant it didn't really get in the way when typing on a computer or doing any other daily activities.Battery-use: Both started with excellent battery life. I routinely got up to 7 days with my Fitbit before needing a charge (similar with the Nike). However, both had gradual degradation in battery life. With the Fitbit, I actually had to get a replacement after 8 months of use since I could no longer get more than 16 hours or so out of one full charge, which meant I had to charge it every night. This also meant that I couldn't take advantage of the sleep-tracking function since it had to be charging.The Nike also lost charge duration over time, but it was slightly less abrupt and a little more gradual than the Fitbit. After about a year with the Nike, I went from 5-7 days/charge to 2-3.Overall:I'd probably recommend the Fitbit over the Nike, if only because it seems to be a little less intrusive in your life. There are many more differences between the two that I'm sure are outlined in other reviews, like intricacies in the software and which phones/mobile devices they can sync with, and I'm happy to answer questions, but these are the main differences which, for me, mean I'd probably choose the Fitbit if I had to choose again. Make sure you order from Amazon, or somewhere with similar great customer service, since I did have to replace it after 8 months, and that was relatively pain-free through Amazon.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R235SJ1B5K20ZV?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Fitbit vs Nike Fuelband - Deciding factors for me"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-06-21", "review_body": "The unit is very reliable and the app is easy to use.

It helps me stay motivated and has been part of a permanent lifestyle change for me. I just wish there was a way to upgrade! They came out with a pink that I would love to have, but I don't need a whole new flex, just the band. The force would be great to have, but I don't think it would be worthwhile to spend $130 for one that does just a little more than what I already have.I did get great service when my band broke, they sent me a new one with no problems and that has held up for the past 3 months.I have had my fitbit flex for almost a week now and it has really helped me stay motivated to get fit.There are only a couple drawbacks that I have encountered. First, it can be somewhat challenging to get the flex latched onto the wrist, the clasp can be difficult. Second, I don't currently have a computer or phone compatible with the app needed to sync. I was using a chromebook, which meant I couldn't download the flex app, and my android phone doesn't have the bluetooth that is needed. I wound up borrowing a computer that I could download the app onto and have ordered one with the necessary bluetooth. Finally, and this just happened today, the website that the flex syncs to was down for a while, which frustrated me. It probably wouldn't have been a problem if I wasn't the type of person that wants to check my progress 20 times a day.Once I got past those problems, I have to admit, this product is amazing! I can track my sleep quality, exercise, use the app to monitor calories, and track progress toward exercise and weight loss goals. I mentioned that I constantly check my progress on the web, and you can actually use fitbit.com to do most of those things, but the great thing about the flex is that you don't have to log everything, it can keep track of your steps, exercise time and intensity, sleep, etc. for several days! I love to go for a run and then come home and see how many steps I took, how long I worked at which level of intensity, and how far I went. It is a great motivator!Update after almost one year: For some reason my flex quit working after 11 months (I may have been wearing it too tight and it needed room to \"breathe\") but when I went to fitbit.com and they sent a replacement immediately. I have already recommended it to several friends and we try to stay ahead of each other. I was lost without it while I waited for the replacement!

So, after many months of use he took it for granted that it wouldn't fall off without the Velcro, but of course he then lost it. I'm glad he got some money's worth out if it, but it's a shame that Fitbit doesn't automatically include some sort of safety latch on the Flex model.

Watch bands have been around for hundreds of years (it's basically a small belt, right?). Yet the clip of the FitBit is difficult to use, especially if placed on your dominant hand (leaving your weak hand to perform the maneuver).  I've seen $1 kids watches with easier clips.While the watch seems to accurately record activity most of the time, the users manual admits that it does better with \"step-based\" activities such as walking.  It snowed twice in the week after I started using my FitBit, but it could not accurately record me shoveling my driveway, a great cardio activity if there ever was one.  It recorded ZERO \"very active minutes\" when I was working hard for at least 30 minutes each time!On the plus side, it works seamlessly with other apps, such as My Fitness Pal.  This is a good way to work around the watches shortcomings, since you can manually enter information such as snow shoveling, which will then sync with the FitBit. MFP also has an easier food tracker, since the FitBit software lacks a barcode reader.  There have been many comments on the FitBit community boards, so I expect this will be corrected in a later software version.Overall, I think it's a good fitness gadget.  I can tell by dinner time whether I've been active enough for a good dessert, or just some fruit.  I hope that some software upgrades may make it better, but if you are a serious fitness person, you might want to avoid disappointment and wait for a new version. 3-stars may be a bit generous, considering all of the hype around this and similar products.UPDATE - I have sent back my FitBit &amp; my wife sent hers, too.  We were noticing that it wasn't accurately collecting sleep data.  Restless nights seemed no different than normal ones, and it registered no steps or awake time nights when I got up to use the bathroom.  I contacted FitBit, who told me that there was a software problem with the sleep monitoring function &amp; they were working on it.  That was the last straw.

I am now ready to step it up to the next model, but I need to stay in the Fitbit family. I love the Fitbit \"community,\" and have connected with friends to compete or encourage. Wonderful product! I've had no problem with accuracy. I can't endorse this product or company enough and I've not been incentivized to do so.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WYTCSSTQHN1S?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "My Fitbit is my BFF!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2013-06-06", "review_body": "I started with a Jawbone Up and liked it. Easier to deal with than a pedometer, good at tracking sleep (I'm narcoleptic, so that's very helpful information for me, especially in appointments with my neurologist), good at tracking activity, interface reasonably good for letting me track food. But I liked the look of the Fitbit Flex better and ordered one of those that was backordered. When it arrived, my plan was to wear the two together for a week and decide at the end of the week which one I liked better and retire the other one.Within a day, I knew that the Up was bound for a drawer and Flex was staying on my wrist. It's far more comfortable for me, for one thing: Up has a pretty rigid top and bottom, but even the flexible sides move only so much, so you really always feel it. (I am an overweight woman but not obese, and I wore the largest Up band. Still definitely felt it all the time.) Flex is, well, flexible, everywhere except the top for about an inch across. Very comfortable, and I usually forget that I'm wearing it. Plus, I can't lie: I think that Flex is much prettier, and the slate color is my favorite grey-blue. Up was the color of a late-1980s PC and pretty ugly, IMO.Flex doesn't require removal from the wrist ever except charging, which is minutes at a time every eight or ten days (I'm saying that from memory; I didn't actually track how long I wore it before having to charge). (Both devices remind you on iOS or OSX with a little alert when your battery is going to need a charge in a couple of days. No idea what either does with Windows or other operating systems.) Flex transmits your data via Bluetooth using a tiny USB receiver plugged into your computer (I'm sure that there are other ways, such as to an iPad or iPhone, but I haven't looked that up) any time you're within 20 feet of the receiver. You can view the data using an app or on fitbit.com. Up requires removal from the wrist to sync and then removal of a little cap from one end to plug it into the headphone jack of your idevice. Odds were good that I'd have lost that little cap before long (I managed not to lose it during the month or so of using Up).Both require you to tell them when you're going to sleep. The signals for this are clearer on Up (a little moon-shaped LED shows up on it when you are in sleep mode and changes to a different shape when you wake it up; on Flex, the only visual interface is a series of lit-up dots, and you have to learn what the various patterns mean). But there aren't but so many signals to learn, so it's not difficult. And Flex's documentation is much better, simpler, and clearer than Up's, making it easier still for the new user to get used to sleep and wake and the other signals.The best thing about either device is the increased awareness of activity (or lack thereof). Both devices let you set goals and connect with other users, if that's your thing. There are lots more things to track using Flex, but I haven't had a chance to explore all of them yet. I expect to like it more as I explore it more.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXBCP0KA1ZKBO?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "not perfect, but really good"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-11-16", "review_body": "Bought this for my wife.

The Charge HR gives you all of your dashboard data and the time without needing to reference a smartphone.  Flex requires you to tap on it to get into the sleep setting. Charge does that independently.  Everyone I know with a Flex has had at least 1 wristband break at the place where the band it thinnest.  The clasp is easy to open and close, which is great for taking it off and tossing it in my purse to wear on my shoulder pushing a shopping cart (otherwise Flex doesn't register the steps).

I gave the edge to the Fitbit Flex because I felt it offered more and I didn't like the look of the Jawbone.  My wife was the first to really put the Flex to the test on her morning 3.5 mile walk pushing our daughter in a stroller. We both liked the wireless syncing but the steps counted and calculated distance were off. We decided to follow the online procedures to calculate the steps and the next day the measurements were closer but not exact.  We attribute this to pushing the stroller and her arm is not swinging freely all the time.I really like the sleep tracking feature.  I work shift work and it gives me a good picture of how much sleep I am getting when I'm working nights and when I'm working days.  It also shows when I'm resless or the times that I get up during the night.The web interface and the android app are great FREE add-ons for an already great product.The Flex has definitely helped my wife and I make a more conscious effort to walk more.  We had the Flex with us on our recent vacation and it was amazing to see how many miles we walked over a 5 day period.The negatives that we have noticed after 3 weeks is the count errs on the conservative side (this can be a positive too because you don't want a product that says you walked more than you actually did because that can lead to an inaccurate calorie burn). You can get false steps counted when scrubing the dishes or other activity that can fool the band into counting steps.  Even though the band is waterproof, if you want to have a more accurate daily count, remove the band when doing the dishes.Amazon showed a 1-3 month back order but it only took 5 weeks for us to receive our Flex bands.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C2LSMG9VUUPM?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "My wife and I enjoy our Fitbit Flex bands - BUY NOW!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-03-30", "review_body": "I've been wearing my Flex for about 6 weeks.

I've not used the additional logs for food, heart rate, blood glucose, and blood pressure.  No huge surprise that I'm too sedentary.  The surprise was with my sleep.  I would have sworn I was getting more sleep and sleeping like a log.  Flex tells me the brutal truth that I am way below the amount of sleep I need and am way more restless during the little sleep I do get.  I am trying slowly, but surely, to increase the amount of sleep I get.

I have had this thing for about 6 weeks now and while it does as advertised; I have a lot of problems with it.  First and foremost, you open the packaging upon arrival and there is practically no information about the thing.  Just the web address for the fitbit,  the website walks you through installation and all that, but I have still not been able to find a concise list or chart or SOMETHING about what all these damn lights mean.  You just learn as you go, which personally drives me crazy. Apparently, you are supposed to receive an email and/or warning when your battery gets low... well, I did a 5k and was so excited to see how many steps I logged when I checked my phone, only to find that it was dead and hadn't logged a thing.

Of the three units my favorite is the Fitbit Ultra.  I gave this 3 stars because while it works well the display on the Flex is pretty minimal and the control for the unit is done by tapping it which is a pretty nebulous process most of the time.  The data collected by all three are consistent and the steps measured and the sleep data are all within a small range of difference so any of these will collect good data.  Fitbit software is pretty easy to set up and runs well although you have to use their web site to view the data (I'd rather have the download and analysis software on my PC but web seems to be the wave of the future).  I use these units mostly to monitor my sleep and counting steps is secondary for me.  The Flex is a very tiny unit, probably 1/3 the physical size of any of the other unit that I've seen.  Putting the actual tracker in and out of the wrist band is kind of a pain but you really only have to do it every 3 or 4 days to charge it as normally it will download the data wirelessly to the USB receiver.  The Flex comes with a small and large wrist band and I have to use the large wrist band on the last available notch so if the circumfrence of your wrist is more than 8 inches the large wrist band might not fit.  To control the functions of the Flex you have to tap the wrist band or the unit itself and maybe i'm not doing it right but it always seems to take a random number of taps to get what I want.  Fortunately when putting it into sleep mode it will vibrate when entering and exiting sleep mode so you know it actually is ready to track sleep.  The display consists of 4 tiny, although very brite LEDs, that flash in various patterns to show status.  I like being able to push a button and seeing a display of steps or time that the Ultra and U3 will display.  The Flex is a fine, quality unit but the lack of a display and the quirky nature of the tap controls caused me to downgrade to 3 stars where the Fitbit Ultra would get 5 stars.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36M8ABUJMN8SU?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Works well with limitations."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-02-04", "review_body": "I am really enjoying my Fitbit Flex.

The flex isn't as full-featured as some other fitness trackers out there, but honestly, it's all I really need. I no longer have to manually input my runs into the app. It's also extremely accurate. I can actually watch the number go up every time I put my foot down.Couple minor things:  - The flex gets confused when I ride my bike. It doesn't count the pedaling as running, but it does go in and out of sleep mode when I'm on rough terrain. After every ride I have to check that it's not in sleep mode. Not too big of a deal but the intermittent vibrating on my wrist while I ride was confusing at first.  - The fitbit app only allows you to track you cardio workouts, not your strength. I know strength doesn't have the same effect on calories that cardio does, but I would like to be able to track it anyway so I can monitor the amount of time I spend on each muscle group.

I was concerned about how accurate the Flex would be since is a wristband instead of a normal pedometer that is worn either on your waistband or in a pocket.  I wore my fitbit in addition to another pedometer and the results were pretty close with the fitbit registering some of my dumbbell exercises as steps and adding to my distance walked results.  I do have two complaints though with the fitbit app.  First fitbit should allow users bring their information from the fitbit app into Apple's healtkit application.  They are not doing this right now and it seems to be because Fitbit is making their own device that will compete with Apple's iWatch.  My second complain is the nutritional tracking portion of the application is somewhat limited in the types of foods that they have for you to select.  Most of the items are not generic versions, but are based on the dishes, and the portion sizes that are served in restaurants.

In addition, the charging process isn't very good either. You have to remove the electronic mechanism from the band to charge, which requires you to twist and pull back the band to wiggle it out.

In reality it is a fancy pedometer- that is only accurate TAKING A DELIVERATE WALK OR RUNNING (it told me I had walked 20 steps while I sat in my chair working-perhaps I'm a vigorous typer?) It is of value if you want to track mileage of walks or runs (think those old Nike wristbands that went with a tracker you could attach to your shoe- except now it's all in your wrist).  If you need motivation to get enough steps every day, you can buy a sufficient pedometer for $30 or less that will rarely need batteries or a recharge.  Also, it counts aerobic steps the same as regular steps- so that is of no help. If you want to be more accurate by adding an activity manually you should remove the fitbit so it's not counting your zumba session and the steps taken separately.  So if you want to track running mileage, well it's going to mess up your other info.  And spin sessions or biking can't be tracked.  It says so right in the help info.So basically I can get everything except a poor sleep tracker if I just buy a cheap pedometer and use a free app like MyFitnessPal (activity tracker and calorie counter/food diary).

I have found it so far all that I have asked it to be.HardwareFirst, I was very wary in buying product due to all the negativity around the wrist band. Please note, the set I was sent had both the large and small size. I found I could use both in a pinch, but have only used the large. The band is a smooth semisoft rubber, several adjustable slits to fit your wrist. Its very comfortable. I could see it being flimsy if you pull it on and off daily. I have left it on for the 5 days and just haven't picked at it. No problems. You have to understand, you wear the wrist band 24/7. The pushing and pulling through the day, specifically at night has to stress it. My hope is to get 100 miles per wristband....I probably will blow that away as I am seeing no wear and tears and will hit that tomorrow.I found the device easy to load into the band and unload and find the tapping to get updates pretty good. The buzzing is strong enough to wake you in the alarm function and to notify you of sleep mode and other functions,SoftwareI find Fitbits software is the reason this only gets 4 stars. First, devices.. READ WHAT DEVICES THE SUPPORT!!! I made the mistake of buying this product for my wife, figuring that since I have a 4s Iphone, her 4 would work. It doesn't! Ridiculous.Product works great and is easily set up on the 4s Iphone. Works great with my laptop by communicating with a little adapter that sits in a USB port of the laptop.The logging of data is very smooth. Although the food log is primitive. They must be expecting customers to log the statistics of different foods and their customers are letting them down. Not easy to find what you are looking for....they didn't have peanut butter and jelly in there! Stats categories include steps, calories in v out, sleep, wake time, miles, active minutes and weight ectAs a pedometer, it's extensive enough to be a serious tracker, I'm just not into it enough yet to get crazy to use it that way. AS a sleep tracker, I love it. I use it the in less sensitive mode and I find it great to give me a real sense of my sleep. They say there is a more sensitive mode, if you have sleep trouble, but I haven' used it. It tracts you sleep, restless and awake points. Mostly by movement of your wrists.

So since I can't have nice things, I replaced it with the Fitbit Zip and I liked it ok but it was lacking some features that I liked on the Fitbit One (like counting stairs and sleep). Then that one malfunction past the warranty so I was without any tracker for months. I really missed the motivation they provided so I decided to look into getting another one. When I saw the flex I thought it might be worth a try because if it is on my wrist I won't lose it (which from other reviews I'm not alone in losing the Fitbit One).I've had the flex for almost a week and decided I am going to return it and get another Fitbit One instead.The reasons I personally don't like it...-There isn't a readable display. It shows you dots and every dot is for 2000. I thought this would be ok but I don't like not seeing the number. I have a smart phone but its not one that Fitbits sync with so I couldn't even look at my phone for the number.-I don't like the way it looks on my wrist. I have small wrists and I just don't like the look of it. Also I couldn't figure out how to track my sleep unless I added the time on the website and I found that cumbersome compared to the One.-It doesn't seem accurate. I have it on my right hand (because I wear a watch on my left) and that is my dominate hand. I was not very active yesterday and based on days like that in the past I know I wasn't over 3-4,000 steps yet the Flex said I was over 6,000. I read that if you have an issue with this to try wearing it on your other hand but I don't want to because I still want to wear a watch. I know the newest one, the Force does have a display but I don't think I'd like the look of the bracelet based on how I feel about the One and that other one is bigger.So back to the One I go and hope I don't lose it again.

The results were very different and not so good for the Fitbit Flex.Nike+ = 4.02 miles.New Balance Via Active pedometer4.11 miles. 9665 steps.Fitbit Flex band3.69 miles???  8276 steps???I tend to think the Nike+ app and the Pedometer are closer to correct since the distances they measured are very close to each other. I have walked the neighborhood before too and think from previous experience that I was right near 4 miles. If that's the case, then why is the Fitbit Flex so low compared to the other two? The Flex battery is fully charged, I just charged it last night. And the numbers are the most recent as I synced the Flex to the computer as soon as I got into the house from the walk.What's more confusing is that originally, I was finding that on a daily basis, the Flex was giving me more steps then I normally took. It still does. So this morning's result is pretty shocking. I definitely have to change my thinking that the Fitbit Flex is to be used more to give you a VERY GENERAL idea of how much you have done and not trusted to give an accurate accounting.Addressing something I said in the original review, Fitbit did send me an XL sized band when I requested it.  I did wear the Flex on my left arm (non-dominant) next to my watch for a few days,  I did not find any appreciable change in the readings the Flex was giving me. So I am back to wearing it on my right arm (dominant) for comforts sake.On the plus side, syncing with the phone and the computer still works mostly flawlessly, though sometimes I cannot sync to the computer because apparently, the Fitbit dongle doesn't always get detected by the computer again when it wakes up from sleep mode. The Fitbit Connect software will tell me the dongle cannot be found. This generally won't correct itself until I reboot the computer.For the accuracy issues, I am taking away a star from my rating and giving it 3 stars.***Original Review***The reason for writing this was to give an idea of the accuracy of the Fitbit Flex.  I took my first walk this morning wearing the Flex. For comparison, I also wore an old style digital pedometer and I also had the Nike + app running on my phone.  Here are the results  after a little more then 3 mile walk.Nike+3.41 miles. 428 caloriesNew Balance Via Active pedometer3.37 miles. 1346 calories 7677 stepsFitbit Flex band3.43 miles 1378 calories 7527 stepsOverall, not too bad. Considering the Nike+ app is using Gps to calculate distance but the other two devices are just using motion sensors, all the results are fairly close. The reason the calorie count for the Nike is so much lower is that it's only showing calories for the amount of distance traveled.  The Fitbit and the pedometer are, I believe, giving what they consider a Total calorie count the body has burned so far in the day since midnight, both from the walk and just by being alive.So in this case, I have to give the Fitbit Flex good marks. BUT, and there is always a but, I do think that when just going about your everyday stuff, the Flex is a little too sensitive.  I remember the average step count the old Fitbit Ultra used to give me after a day of work and the Fitbit Flex is consistantly 1000 steps or more higher for a day. I have also tested it myself, downloading the data now, and then downloading again say 15 to 30 minutes later when I have just been sitting at the computer or after just moving the steering wheel while driving. And sure enough, the step count will have gone up some. I am sure it's picking up just the random motion of the arm while typing, moving the mouse around or just doing other random stuff and counting it as steps.  Fitbit even says on its website that: \"Flex is a motion sensor on your wrist. There are many instances where your hands may be moving, but your body may not be, such as playing the drums, cooking, or even burping a baby. Flex may count some extra steps here and there to give you credit when it thinks you are active.\"So if you need something that's dead on accurate for a whole day of activity, this may not be the best thing for it. But for actually walking/running, the Fitbit Flex seems to have done a pretty good job.Additionally, I find the Flex mostly comfortable to wear and you forget it's there.  I currently wear the Flex on my dominant hand because I have a watch on the non-dominant hand.  Fitbit does suggest wearing the band on the non-dominant hand. Maybe once I get the XL band, I can wear the Flex next to my watch on the other arm (it won't fit higher on that arm now) and the accuracy might improve.I have the Fitbit Connect software on my computer and have the Fitbit app on my Galaxy S3 phone.  Syncing works flawlessly with both of them.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y1V59TOAE1I4?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Fitbit Flex vs New Balance Via pedometer vs Nike+ app"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-10-15", "review_body": "I wore the Fitbit with the expectation that I wasn't going to make any sweeping changes, but that it would be helpful to know just how much of a couch potato I am.  i figured that was a start:-)  I set the daily target to 5,000 steps, instead of the pre-programmed 10,000 steps.

After a few days, I noticed that I was tending to be less \"efficient\" in my activities - I am a master at avoiding steps; and habitually loaded grocery bags all over my arms to avoid having to walk back to the car.  Less efficient, obviously = more steps.  And this let me see just how much difference a few steps here and there throughout the day could make.  After several months - as my daily average kept moving up slowly, I also started logging my food (a very complete list of items automatically comes up on your screen when you type in something like \"coffee\" or \"bread\").

I'm devoted to my Fitbit, so when I lost it somewhere on my weekly grocery shopping trip with my daughter, I was hearbroken.  (The wrist band is my only reservation: it can be difficult to fasten securely if you have arthritis).  When I emailed them, they asked for some information, and to my surprise they just wrote to say that a replacement is on  its way.  How cool is that???  My only suggestion is that you think carefully about the most secure model for you: the Flex comes with two wrist bands of different sizes; or a clip-on model, which I think you can also wear around your neck.  It has capabilities that I haven't tapped into yet, but so far this strikes me as a brilliant basic tool for helping you be mindful of \"energy expended\" vs. \"caloric intake\".

We have been using it for a week and a half so far. As others have mentioned, the device is not perfect if you want to put it under a microscope for how accurate it measures steps and calories burned for different types of activities. However, it does a great job measuring overall daily activity as a whole and motivates you to reach your goals each day. So you may be doing a little more than you need but there is nothing wrong with that. On the Fitbit website you set your weight loss and food plan goals then follow what it tells you for calories in and calories out. The hardest plan focuses on losing 2 pounds a week and following the plan closely, I lost 2.4 pounds after week 1. My mother lost about 1.8 also on the hard 2 pounds a week plan. My mother absolutely loves it and you can't get her to stop checking her stats and going out for walks.  The website was very flaky the first few days I used it but seems to have stabilized since then. So if you are looking for an overall activity tracker and motivator to lose weight or stay in shape, I recommend the Flex. If you need something that is 100% accurate counting every step of the day or most of your activities do not involve arm movement, the Flex might not be for you. Keep in mind that for those activities that do not log as you would expect, you can enter them manually on the site and will replace what the Flex logged for that time period so you do not double dip.UPDATE 8/29/2013: Forgot to mention in my original review that the support for Android devices is very limited.

I did my research before purchasing and decided on the Flex because of it's ability to be worn while swimming or in the shower.  As a busy mom, I don't have time to worry about taking it off before doing the dishes or anything else that might get it wet, so that was the clincher for me.I received my Flex on New Years Eve, so I started wearing it on New Years Day.  It was very easy to charge and to set up an account, and I have had no problem with the clasp.  (I just made very sure that both prongs were all the way through, and they have been secure.  I love the fact that I am wearing it all the time, and I don't have to remember to put it on or forget where I put it.  I am wearing it on my right (dominant) hand, because I wear a watch on my left hand, but that has not seemed to add many steps.  There have been several days where I have hit over 10,000 steps (just under 5 miles for me) - just because it is a constant reminder!The silent alarm is another plus of the Flex.  I had been using the my smartphone on vibrate, but it would still often waken my husband.  This is much more silent, and the fact that it is vibrating on my wrist wakens me even more quickly than the phone vibrating beside me.  You can also set multiple alarms, so it can be used as reminders throughout the day.That said, there are a couple of things that I wish were better.  First, I wish that I could get more information from the Flex itself than just percentage of my step goal or putting it into (or taking it out of) sleep mode.  (You can change the percentage to reflect things like calories burned, miles walked, etc., but you can only choose one goal.)  I would like to be able to cycle through those things.  Furthermore, I would love the immediate feedback of knowing how many steps I have taken without waiting to look at my computer.  (The Flex will sync to some smartphones, but not to my Droid Razr.)  Since I am wearing this on my wrist, it would also be nice to have it function as a watch.  I really would have preferred the Force for these reason, but Fitbit doesn't recommend wearing the Force in the shower or swimming.  As I stated earlier, that was a deal breaker on the Force for me.Another drawback of the Flex (and, in my understanding, the Force) is that steps really aren't counted while pushing a shopping cart or stroller.  It is a real bummer to not have my steps counted after a day of shopping for my family!  I am going to have to start making sure I have pockets when I am shopping so that I can put the Fitbit in my pocket.It would be nice to also have a heartrate monitoring function, but I'm guessing that will be a part of a future product!All in all, I am happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to friends.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJO4T71MSOVD3?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_title": "My Fitbit has greatly increased my activity in the last month!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-11-17", "review_body": "Does everything I need it to do.

It does not accurately count steps when you're on a treadmill, pushing a shopping cart, or pushing a stroller. I do the majority of my walking doing one of these, so it has never been accurate for me. It's so discouraging doing 3.5 miles on the treadmill, to have my fitbit say I went 1.5 miles. Or do an hours worth of grocery shopping to get 100 steps.I have yet to figure out what the activity tracker is actually tracking. I walk/jog 3.5 miles a day on the treadmill, always at the same speed. It has never given me the same number of activity minutes.The sleep tracker was one of the main reasons I bought the fitbit. It's a total joke. I will get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and it never says I'm awake. Again, I don't know what it actually tracks, but it's definitely not accurate.The biggest flaw I've found, is putting it in and out of sleep mode. You are supposed to tap continually for 2 seconds to put into/take out of sleep mode. The problem is any quick movements send it to sleep. Almost daily, I go to check my progress, and it's in sleep mode.

While Fitbit did replace my original Flex that died after 3 months, the new one has now died as well after about one month.  I've ordered a different product that takes a battery, the device isn't rechargeable.  It is just as expensive.  I hope it works.  I'm done with Flex.  No more.2nd update - I give Fitbit Customer Service credit for standing behind their product.  They will be sending a replacement, which I hope lasts a good while.  I really do like the product; it is easy to use, keeps track of my steps accurately and tells me how well I've slept. I also like how it communicates with both My Fitness Pal (calorie &amp; exercise tracker) and Virgin Pulse (program to track steps to earn medical expense dollars thru employer health benefits).Original Post - While the Flex was great while it worked, after only 3 months the battery will not hold a charge more than a few hours.  Very sad.1st Update:  Fitbit provides a public apology on Amazon, but has not reponded to my email to Customer Service other than to ackowledge the email.  On Amazon they suggest checking out solutions to the terminally ill battery on their website which I had already done.  I followed all the advice on resetting the device and cleaning the terminals, and saw all the comments from other purchasers with the SAME ISSUE who had no resolution.

I made sure to place the flex on my non-dominate wrist as suggested.  The first two days I used it I discovered how inaccurate it was.

The idea, per the FitBit Flex website is that the sensitivity setting would be reduced when told it was on my dominate wrist.  Since then I've had it go off several times to tell me I had met my step count while I was sitting at my desk.I do figit a lot and rock in my desk chair.

It also estimates calories burned, lets you record your meals, and gives other information.Here are some weaknesses:1. Almost everything goes through FitBit's Internet server. If that server goes down, then your FitBit won't be very useful.2. I found it difficult to snap on the wristband; it took me about ten minutes.  Perhaps this will get better with time.3. Even if your Android device has Bluetooth 4.0, synchronization doesn't work with devices that FitBit doesn't list on their website.  So, though I can install the Android software on my Nexus 7 (2013), I can't synchronize through it.  (I'm lucky that I have a cell phone that it does synchronize with.)UPDATE:After several weeks, I'm still using my FitBit and its website. It still works to get me more active.Snapping on the wristband has become much easier with time.FitBit has one more advantage: it integrates with other websites. My wife, who has her own FitBit, uses MyFitnessPal for its excellent calorie counter.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18DIZ27LNEXF8?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Excellent device, as long as Fitbit.com lasts."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-06-18", "review_body": "Failed less than one day in.

After about three weeks of use I can say that it mostly works as advertised. It's step detection during walking is accurate but there are a few problems. First, it misses steps during sprints on the treadmill. Second, it is not useful on the elliptical trainer since I hold on to the handles to stabilize myself. It worked reasonably well when I tucked it inside the top of my socks while on the elliptical.The sleep function is rudimentary. It doesn't actually tell you (it can't) whether you slept well or not. It acts as an actigraph, simply recording how much you moved during sleep. If you lay still while awake, the Fitbit would show you as sleeping. As an indicator of restlessness, it is probably reasonable.The synchronization with a smartphone is excellent and a great way to check your goals. The web interface is good as well. The food intake tracker doesn't work well for me as it won't allow me to go enter the previous day's meals and there is no way to enter a meal and adjust the date backwards.Finally, the quality of the wristband is poor. In just three weeks, there is a split in the band even though I always take it off when I shower and avoid getting it wet. Almost certainly I will need to replace the band soon.UPDATE:I emailed FitBit about the crack in the wristband and they have promised to replace it, though I have not yet received the replacement.Today I started having charging problems with my device. When I put it into the cradle and plug it in, the LED flashes once then goes off. I thought maybe the battery was too low so left it alone for an hour. Still no lights came on (it is supposed to flash when charging). When I gently push the FitBit into the cradle and hold it, the lights flash as they are supposed to showing charging. As soon as I let it go, the device goes dead. I have cleaned the contacts but the problem seems to be with the fit of the device into the cradle.

I bought it because I thought it would be useful to count steps -  I had about 15 pounds to lose and wanted to make sure I was getting consistent exercise.Turns out that for me, the real benefit is keeping track of calories in vs. out.  I really had no idea that I was overeating so much (like an extra 800-1000 calories on some days).  It takes a fair amount of work that the Fitbit does NOT do to get good estimates of caloric intake,  especially since we eat very little packaged food.  But taking the time to calculate how much a meal preparation has (in terms of calories) is an eye opener.  It also showed me that my biggest problem was portion control, and 'seconds'.  I typically drank very little water, but now I routinely hit 2500ml (85oz) a day.The step counter is motivational, as you want to hit that goal every day.  The ability to check your progress without the smartphone interface is cool too.  The software is easy to use and customizable, so you can look at all of the  available data or just the things most important to you.  There's a lot of caloric data in the database, but I frequently build custom foods using online databases of ingredients.  The band is comfortable and has a good adjustment range.  The clasp takes a little getting used to, but is not poorly designed, it's just different.Bottom line - Fitbit helped me realize how much I was overeating, motivates me to hit my steps/water/exercise activity goals, and I'm down 8# in 3 weeks:182 to 174.

I had one given to me as a gift about a year ago. I enjoyed it very much, though setting it up was a bit of a hassle (why should a bluetooth device need a USB connection to set up these days?). It worked well for about 2 months and then mysteriously died (it would only flash two white dots (usually a sign of low battery), no matter how charged it was). I wasted a lot of time trying to fix it and finally contacted FitBit. They took a long time to respond and made me get a receipt for my gift (always in good taste vs. just requiring the defective item be returned to them) before finally sending me another.That one worked for about a year and now it will no longer sync. When I tried removing it from my device and re-adding it, I found that--once again--I needed the USB to set it up... (despite the updates that added new functionality like automatic sleep tracking, they still can't figure this out?). Forget it... for the amount of money paid, it should not be this much of a hassle.On the positive, the hardware itself is pretty good, though the band material seems to suffer from degradation after about 6 months... The small latch they provide to close it usually works well, but sometimes refuses to close completely and can be awkward to put on.The battery life is exceptional--one 4-hour charge usually lasts 7 - 10 days. Even when the low battery warning comes on (via your cellphone or email alert), it is usually sufficient to last the rest of the day.The app is probably the best feature, as other reviews in the news have mentioned. Challenging your friends is enjoyable and works very well (they even have a taunt option!). Step tracking is pretty accurate, but can be easily fooled... I noticed that sitting in a rocking chair with my newborn racked up an enormous amount of steps when it shouldn't have. On the positive, when the clasp doesn't work for you anymore, simply putting it in a pants pocket works about as well as having it on your wrist.Overall, the product can be a lot of fun (when it works), but I would have expected these kind of bugs and annoyances with a $20 piece of electronics, not with something of this price level.I switched to an Apple Watch... while far more expensive and needs daily charging, it does a lot more and has fewer bugs (and will usually last about 24 hours between charges). I can only speak to my experience with the FitBit Flex model, but I am disappointed with FitBit's lack of quality and lack of care... it's like they took their product and said 'Meh, good enough.' I can not recommend this product based on my experience and would advise someone spend a little more and get either an Apple Watch or one of the better rated Android watches. If you do not need a smart watch and want something to just track your general fitness, a quasi-smart watch (like the kind by Polar or other fitness brands) would be a better choice.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F5185MF0Y8TT?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "A fun product, but one that needs a lot of work..."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-10-01", "review_body": "In a nutshell, the Fitbit Flex is an overpriced, marginally accurate pedometer with a few extra bells and whistles. It's useful in many ways, but also frustrating at times. I have to say there are a few features I haven't yet tried, but I've used it long enough to write a review.First, the cons:  1. The pedometer, or step counter feature, as I have said, is only marginally accurate. I have a decent pedometer which I know to be quite accurate and which I have used for some time. The Fitbit count averages probably 15-20% off. Sometimes it undercounts, usually the count is considerably over. That is probably because it is worn on the wrist, and if I scratch my head or talk using my non-dominant hand (where it is worn,) it counts as steps. At the end of the day, I can have some 2000 steps not recorded on my pedometer. If you push a cart in a market for 30 minutes, or walk pushing a baby stroller or carrying a bag in that hand, it tends to count very few steps. This can lead to a substantial undercount. If I walk with my hands free at my sides, the Fitbit and pedometer are almost completely in sync.  2. My Fitbit syncs with My Fitness Pal, a valuable feature. However, it tends to exaggerate the extra calories I am entitled to from exercise. If I ate back all the extra calories Fitbit tells me I have burned, I would probably gain a pound or so a week.  3. The battery has to be charged about every 5 days, a bit of a nuisance. My pedometer is not rechargeable, is larger and has fewer features, but the batteries last a long, long time.  4. The flex is very small, so there is no readable display, so you have to read results elsewhere. You can gain some info from the lights, but they can be a bit of a nuisance to figure out.Pros:  1. It is small, easy to wear, and can be worn in the shower, though it can be a bit difficult to put on, especially for an older person.  2. The wireless sync with the computer is nice, and allows you to get a lot of information (even when it's not always as accurate as I might like.) It's also nice that it syncs with My Fitness Pal. This saves a lot of time (but see the caveat above)  3. I especially like the sleep evaluation feature. I feel that this is giving me a pretty accurate picture of my sleep patterns, and the sleep efficiency rating is helpful.I have enjoyed my Fitbit Flex and the feedback it gives has helped motivate me. Would I buy it again? I'm not sure. I might try a different Fitbit model. The negatives I have noted above, even though I compensate for them as much as possible, still irritate me at times.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XBWTA0YX3MKC?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "A marginally accurate pedometer with some extra features"}], [{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-06-02", "review_body": "I love my fit bit, however it is so annoying when it falls off your wrist.

I was especially interested in the quality of the sleep I get and have changed some of my habits based on the feedback the Fitbit provides. I now go to bed earlier because I see that I always wake at 5 or 5:30. When you go to bed at 1 or 2 am, it's just not enough sleep.

It's all very organized and easy to use. The bracelet hasn't give me a rash or anything weird, and is pretty discreet. I also like the vibration when you reach your step goal (you can change this to a calorie goal too I think); it always makes me smile to know I've hit my goal and get that little reminder.Cons: The accuracy seems to leave something to be desired. I have a small kitchen that you only need to take 1 big step or 2 small steps to cross. It seems that all the time I spend in the kitchen cooking and doing dishes often results in ZERO steps because my strides are smaller. Also, getting it to go into sleep mode is very annoying. You're supposed to tap it repeatedly for a few seconds, but most nights it seems to just want to flash my step progress (the 2 taps) instead of registering multiple taps. I don't need that kind of agitation before bed. Finally, as someone who works out 6 days a week, I find it annoying to have to track my activity separately.  It really can only accurately calculate calorie burn from running and walking (assuming you're doing these on a flat surface). If I do yoga, stepmill, or lift weights, I still have to go in and manually log when I did those things and for how long which sort of defeats the purpose of wearing a tracker.Update 4/17/15: I felt it was necessary to update because I'm finding durability to be a significant issue. 3 months into owning this, the band broke off at the top. Fitbit replaced it, but it took them a week to answer my email and mail it. Now 6 months after owning it the charger no longer works. It's completely dead.  I emailed Fitbit to replace that, and got a \"it may not be under warranty\" reply.

I'm up several times a night with kids and it definitely catches that.

I went downhill skiing, for 3 days, and there are very few steps tracked during that activity because I guess I wasn't taking steps, but I was being active.  Swimming I noticed the same thing, I was tredding water for approximately 10 minutes, but no steps were calculated during that aerobic activity.My other complaints about it focus on the \"sleep\" function, which is activated by tapping multiple times on the device.  Other things also can start the sleep option, for instance, clapping my hands a few times in a row puts the Fitbit to sleep, or pushing a grocery cart on a rough surface also engages that function.  These are minor inconveniences, but I don't know if it will still track my steps when it thinks I am \"asleep\", so I have to watch it closely if I think I am doing something that may put it to sleep.In general I haven't had any issues with things that others complained about, I think the band is comfy, it is easy to fasten (after the first few days), it doesn't irritate my skin and I have gotten it wet (in the swimming pool) and it still works just fine.

Three weeks isn't much of a life for a fitness band.======================================Update 10/8/2014For the past 4 weeks, the tracker has been having daily syncing issues with iOS8 and some of the fitness apps I use, and now I hear that the makers of Fitbit are not planning to integrate with Apple's HealthKit (available with iOS8). This may or may not be a dealbreaker for people thinking of buying a Fitbit, but it's worth bearing in mind for Apple device owners if Fitbit decides never to integrate. I considered lowering my star rating from 3 to 2, but the tracker itself still has a good amount of utility of integration is not an issue for the user. To me, it's regrettable that the data collected by Fitbit (about me) is not freely accessible for me to use as I wish.

The idea is to wear this device day and night, and each time you are near your computer (or smartphone in somecases), data is automatically uploaded through a bluetooth dongle.You can then log into your Fitbit dashboard and track various statistics over time.  These would include steps/day, calories/day, sleep quality, food intake..etc.I thought it would be interesting to wear the device to understand what my work and leisure lifestyle is like (outside of my normal every other day running routine).  Then on the days I run, I also wanted to compare my actual distances and steps with those recorded by the fitbit device.  Alas, my conclusion is that this device is no more than a toy and users should not base a exercise and diet program on the data provided by it.  Some serious issues crop up that cause me to believe that these devices have been either rushed into production or just have inherent flaws that make them inaccurate.  Some examples:1)  I was looking forward to understanding my sleep patterns. The fitbit is supposed to record deep sleep, restless sleep and times awakened.  Just before you go to sleep each night, you put the device into \"sleep mode\" to record this data.  In my case I discovered that I have not slept 1 minute in the last 3 weeks.  Fitbit support says this is a known problem they are working on.2.  Fitbit is overly generous in giving you credit for steps.  The manufacturer claims that is because you will burn calories while doing other things, and the awarding of steps is their way of crediting you for those calories burned.  But if the point is to take 10,000 steps per day, then one should be trying to meet that goal, not getting credit for just moving their arms.3.  The food intake log is primitive and the food database appears to be crowd-sourced from other fitbit users.  You basically have to make up your own favorites and assign calories to them to get any reasonably accurate data.4.  The activity log is also primitive and crowd-sourced.  My favorite search result is number of calories burned for \"sitting in squad car\".5.  Battery life - Fitbit claims users should get up to 9 days battery life between charges.  In reality, I get know more than 36 hours which means I have no data for a full half day every other day.  Pretty much ruins the concept of continuous tracking.6.  Warranty - Beware Amazonians - if you do not purchase the fitbit from fitbit.com, you do not get the 45 day money-back guarantee.  All you get is a limited warranty for replacement, and the warranty terms on the web site do not give you any instructions on how to make a return under the limited warranty.7.  On-line support - Support is email only, or through the fitbit community.  Responses can take several days.  In 3 cases where I felt the product was not working correctly, support informed me that all were known problems that were being worked on in future releases.  It wasn't clear if by \"future release\", they meant the Fitbit dashboard, or the device itself.All in all, I think I would wait another year before trying it out again.  If there were a way to return it for a full refund, I would, but can't because I bought it through Amazon.

I used it for a few months back at the beginning of 2014 then put it in the drawer and forgot about it until November of 2015.  I plugged it in and it fired right back up.  It seems to very accurately track steps whether you're swinging your arm or holding your phone and reading an email as you walk.  I love the technology.  I have two complaints and when I mean \"complaints\" they are extremely minor.  I have had one instance where the tracker actually recorded me taking steps when I was driving a car.  For about 5 hours I was getting very small numbers of steps every 15 minutes.  It was a junky company car that shakes and rattles a lot so I'm chalking it up to that.  It's never happened any other time in any other vehicle.  Second is the new update to automatically recognize sleep and awake times.  Before going to bed I watch TV and am not active so the tracker believes I've gone to sleep even though its registering (and displaying) a lot of movement and awake time.  I have to go back in and correct the data to show a more accurate sleep time when I wake each morning.  I believe this will be a fix they make soon to correct the issue.  All in all this Fitbit Flex has been awesome and has encouraged me to be more active.  I really like the user interface on both my computer and my phone.

My only real complaint are that steps do not recorded as accurately as the other fitbit pedometers -- simply tapping my hand or waving will alter the number of steps taken.  I use the large wristband provided with the flex, but have had the clasp snap off unexpectedly several times.  I keep the wristband connected at a comfortable length; it is not tight around my wrist which could explain the problem.  I think this must be a problem others have had, because fitbit sells replacement clasps.  The flex also does not measure the number of stairs taken; it wasn't until I received the device that I learned of this and then a week later the fitbit force was released which includes this feature, along with a clock, and call details from your mobile phone.

But, she and I bought two of these, one for each of us.There's a much longer review by someone else that pretty much says it all, but I'll give you my view of it.I've had the flex for a week.  It is working to motivate me - for now.  Let's see how it goes over time -- after -- the novelty wears off.  So, I like the device, but not for the price.  Personally, I think it was over-hyped.  I'm a techie and expected a bit more than I got.First, you get a USB dongle to sync your device to a computer - that's good.  But, since I have Bluetooth on my Android phone, I was expecting to be able to sync with it too.  Not the case - that's bad.  Sure, there's an app so you can connect to your on-line dashboard, but it doesn't update until you're close to wherever the USB dongle is connected.  It would be great if it could sync in real time with my phone and I could get up-to-the-minute updates on the phone I normally carry with me.  You really have to pay attention to the \"Syncs automatically with select mobile devices and to your computer\" statement.  Look - there are other phones out there than the iPhone.  With as many Droids out there already, I'm surprised there isn't an app that works well with the device.Second, Like the other reviewer mentioned, it does not give you how many calories you REALLY burned.  I'm sure it makes a good attempt at calculating your burned calories by taking into account your weight, the number of steps you've taken, and so on.  But if you do other activities that are not measurable by a pedometer, you're not going to get an accurate burn count.Third, the free fitbit account is usable.  For the price I paid for this device, I expected more.  You can go premium, and pay the extra $$, but I say: I already paid a premium.  Include the reports and everything else premium offers and now you're talking.  If nothing else, if it was include for a year or two to get you going, then pay after that, THAT would be a deal.  It could be a bit more user friendly.  I like the tiles and reorganizing features of the dashboard.  More of that on the other pages and it would be much better.Fourth, I like the silent alarm feature.  I think this is a cool feature.  I hope to make use of the multiple alarm feature as a reminder to be more alert.  More on this in a future review.Fifth, as has already been said, it needs more sensors; my addition: for the price.  GPS? Heart-rate monitor?  Fuse these and other sensors to make a truly smart device that provides more accurate information.Sixth, needs to go open source, or open API(and I don't mean the web APIs already available) so that other, savvy, developers can interface directly with the device and make more, interesting, apps available.I hope to provide an update in about a month to see where I really stand with this device at that time.  It's not a bad device.  I am using it.  I'm currently motivated with it.  Time will tell if I'm still using it in a month.Tony.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I0TM5ZOKZGYN?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Overpriced Pedometer - but working for now."}], [{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2016-01-01", "review_body": "I would loVe to say that I \u2665 this Fitbit but I have to be honest and say it's just \"okay\".

I also really wish you could track progress on macros on the app. The whole calories in vs calories out mentality is outdated- we all know now that all calories are not created equal. Tracking just my calories really does nothing for me. I also think there needs to be a difference between tracking your overall calories out, including just breathing, sitting like it does, and your exercise time. I may burn 1,000 calories sitting at my desk, but that shouldn't be included in my eating calorie budget. I've continued to use MyPlate/Living Social to track my food and exercise instead of the Fitbit app, it seems to be more accurate and I can track my macros (carbs, fat, protein).

I ride a bike quite a bit and today after a 45 minute ride, I made sure it synced with my computer.

I'm a definitely a nerd and this appealed to me. I loved the Ultra and over the next year to year and a half, I probably missed wearing it only a handful of days. Then it pulled a vanishing act between my apartment and the bus stop. After failing to find it, I ordered the Flex.The pluses (compared to the Ultra or the One or Zip):I like that the Flex has a wrist band --- it isn't going to pull a vanishing act like my Ultra did, or at the very least I would hopefully notice sooner.I had problems with the wrist band for sleep tracking coming undone during the night and the Velcro losing its stick over time with the Ultra.It is easier to keep on as I wear it on my wrist and it is waterproof. When I forgot to wear the Ultra, it was almost always because I forgot it put it back on after a shower or in the morning rushing out the door.Cons:It doesn't track stairs. I was really disappointed when I got it and found that out as I really liked the stairs metric and badges.It doesn't have a useful display. You get 1-5 lights on the display instead of a readout like the other models. I think this was simply due to the small size of the Flex compared to the other models as the Force (now discontinued) shows the data. It doesn't matter much for me, I normally would look at the data online, but having something on my wrist and not being able to get the time out of it is frustrating at times. But this is a really small \"frustration.\"It is less \"discrete\" than the One/Ultra/Zip. It doesn't look bad but it is out-of-place with more formal outfits. The One/Ultra/Zip could be discretely tucked into the pocket or a bra strap and be nearly entirely invisible.If you are willing to pay the little extra, the Flex makes a great tracker for a forgetful person. It is also a good tracker for the \"loss adverse\" (like I was after losing my Ultra).

It does not deliver what it markets. First, because it tracks only hand/arm movements, it is grossly inaccurate as an activity tracker.  You can literally stand still in the kitchen chopping veggies and rack up huge activity \"steps.\" Second, it markets itself as calculating calories burned and then has the nerve to report how many calories you have left to consume for the day--you guessed it, based on grossly inaccurate activity results.  Not only is it not capable of calculating calories burned with any accuracy, whatsoever, how much harm could it be doing by recommending that you consume ever increasing amounts of calories, based on the overestimation of activity?? (Why would you want to consume additonal calories burned, anyway?) Finally, it cannot and does not at all track or monitor your sleep. It tracks the movement of your hand or arm during the time that it is activated in sleep mode. No movement does not indicate sleep, just as movement does not indicate the absence of sleep. So, this is a total waste of money.I'll give an example of results.  I used the Flex during a walk(1 min)/run (1 min) exercise activity for 60 mins and 3.3 miles. Since it does not calcuate any idividual activities, but only gives cummulative data, I wrote down the calories burned before and after the activity, performing highly advanced mathematics to subtract and come up with the difference as calories burned.  It told me that I had burned over 800 calories. Great news!! 800 MORE calories to eat that day! When I work out really hard on my AMT for 60 mins at level 10, the machine and my Garmin+heart rate monitor (and earlier my Polar+heart rate monitor) tell me that I am extremely lucky to get to 600 calories burned. So, how nice that I can go out for a gentle walk/jog and burn so many more calories than I would having to actually work hard on the machine! Suspicious, I bought the Garmin+heart rate monitor and did a test.  I used the Garmin+heart rate monitor to walk(1 min)/run (2 min) for the exact same route of 3.3 miles--guess what? Only 198 calories! Guess I will have to skip the double scoop ice cream sundae!

I ordered a replacement (large black) wristband from the Fitbit store, waited over three months, but it never shipped.  The lack of an altimeter was also disappointing after using the Ultra.  What was even more disappointing was the announcement of the Force, coming just months after I invested in the Flex.  The Force included an altimeter and a much needed display.I bit the bullet and purchased a Fitbit Force in late December.  I returned home after a workout last weekend to find that my Force was gone from my wrist. Apparently the clasp design is not quite secure enough, and the tracker came off during my workout.  After contacting Fitbit customer service, I was told they \"have no way to determine the manufacturing defect of the Force's wristband\".  I am among many who have reported issues with the design of the Force wristband clasp.So, now I am back to using my old Flex, with a wristband currently held together by scotch tape.  Even if I wanted to purchase a replacement Force, I cannot as it's been taken off the market due to a small percentage of users reporting a skin rash from the band.  - A once loyal, now disappointed, heavily invested Fitbit customer", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1REAZ02M8EGD5?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "No altimeter, replacement parts not available, poorly engineered wristband and clasp"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-07-12", "review_body": "I have owned the fitbit flex for about a year.

And by logging/journaling, particularly food, I have started seeing that on days I felt like I had eaten lightly and healthy, the calories for this snack or that extra helping of something adds up really quick.Cons that keep me from giving it 5 stars: - doesn't detect/track heart rate - you have to use something else and then log it - doesn't seem to recognize intensity of effort for recumbent exercise bikes - water does get into the band cavity where the Fitbit tracker is inserted, but when I'm logging (easier on computer if you're adding new foods), I take the opportunity to remove the fitbit tracker to charge it and use a Q-tip to clean out the cavity.Overall, I love it!

First off, let me say that this product is great (when it works). I found it to be very accurate and I thought it was great that you can literally count every calorie that your body intakes. Whether you go out and you can look it up through their app or enter it in manually. The sleep aspect of it is really great too. Always wonder why sometimes you slept better than some nights? The Fitbit Flex tells you if you were either restless, asleep or awake and for how long. Great tracking of everything. The big and major downfall to this product was the lack of the ability to stay synced to my cell phone. My android is brand new this year so I know it isn't the phone. Every few hours I would check to see where I stood on my goals and I would discover that it hadn't synced to my phone in the last several hours so it didn't count anything that I had done. I grew tired of constantly having to check to make sure it was synced. When I first discovered that it was not syncing often I would just plug it back into the charger and just reset it.

It is accurate with the step counter. It is light weight and I barely notice it I even wear it in the shower. The only drawback really is that you have to remember to log your food and sometimes you aren't able to find the food that you are eating or maybe you aren't sure on the portion size so you might have to guess how many calories or if you are at work and don't have time to get on your phone to log the food you can go back and log it later but sometimes I forget. Another thing I didn't like is that the wrist bands aren't very durable, but they do sell replacement ones online. For me the band only lasted a month, but then again I am a mechanic so that is fairly understandable. If you are serious about getting into shape get one of these.Some of the really cool features are the sleep monitor,You can also set alarms.  It isn't bulky so you don't have to worry about unwanted attention from other people who ask a million questions(you know the type if you're an introvert like me but you could just get the one that tells time and say its a watch.) I like how the app is an easy way to track your weight and other stats and it recommends how many calories to take in if you want to meet your goals. It is easy to log your water,  the app has user friendly charts, and there are lots of support groups online. Another neat feature is that you can tell it to map your walk. there's a lot more you can tell it to do but that's what I do with it.Something that needs to be fixed is on the windows 8 app I wish there were a way to move around the icons. Like they have a huge emphasis on competing with your friends and it'll say like hey you are number one among your friends! and I'm like Hey that's great too bad I don't have any ftibit friends! or same deal when it tells you that you can lose more weight by competing with people.

I was thrilled that it said i'd get it Saturday, instead of Wednesday ( 1/2/14 ) Just like Amazon said, it came Saturday afternoon. I guess I lucked out on shipping because Amazon's warehouse was one hour away from me. In order to view the stats of the Fitbit, you need to use the app or website, so for that reason, I'll review it. The app ( For IOS ) is confusing in the beginning. However, on the other hand, the version for Android is very simple, and appears, to me anyway, cleaner and more updated. They are both copies of each other but some of the layout is different. The Fitbit website is also very complex and is taking me awhile to get used to. Now, for signing up for Fitbit. When I first made my account I tried to enter my correct age, however, for some reason, you need to be 18. I am not over eighteen, so in order to make the account I had to change my age to a incorrect one. On the app I can then go and change my age to the correct one. To the actual Fitbit Flex. Once it arrived, I charged it and set it up with my account, which was all extremely easy. But it took quite a-while to get to five lights. I thought maybe they had changed it to only four lights to mean fully charged. Be patient, it will eventually finish. I've heard many different views about it being Water proof or not. Some say they won't even take it in the shower, some say they take it swimming. For $100 I rather keep it out of water until Fitbit personally says it is safe to take it in the water. The alarm and all that are very cool add-ons, but for $100?In the end, it comes down to a matter of opinion and the amount of money you have. Would I buy another? No. Nothing is wrong with it, but I rather go for a more solid tracker, like a Nike Sports band.

Based on my heart rate, it should have detected ~300 calories burned.2. It also on daily basis tells me incorrect number calories I still have to consume. For example, I have set a 500 calorie deficit under my goals (+/- 50 cal as per Fitbit calculations). By 4 PM, I would burn about 1800 calories and consume 900-1000 calories. Instead of saying I have another ~400 calories remaining to consume, Fitbit would say I can consume another 1400 calories.

DISTANCE - of course, it uses STEPS to calculate the distance I moved, this number is definitely incorrect. According to its data, I was moving 1.12 miles while play with my son3. CALORIES BURNED: how does this calculate? I burned 1052 calories in 30 mins playing with my son! Wow...I guess I can start packing all my burgers wherever I go to keep my body working since I can burn calories that quick.4. WEIGHT LOSS: I was playing with my son for 30 minutes. The stats show: 5 minutes active, 5000+ steps, 1052 calories burned, BUT I LOST 0.1lbs - I can't figure out the proper formula/equation to fit all these numbers together.5.

I have read and reread and reread the directions: they are confusing, unclear, and poorly written. I have downloaded the software three times in the hope its performance might improve.HOWEVER, it has not worked since day one. The silent alarm goes off at random times. The light display does not always match the desired function. The battery does not always charge and may take several attempts. The sleep mode readouts are funky and inconsistent: today, I learned that I slept 19 hours and 50 minutes?  I don't trust the sleep outcomes.Where is the science behind that function? You have not demonstrated any methodology. Was this item ever tested? If so, why don't you share the testing results. Water gets in the Fitbit pocket when I take a shower and stays there: that can't be good even though you assure me it is OK. The clasp for the band is very sexy but very difficult to use. $100 was far too much to pay for something that has performed so poorly. On the plus side, it is a good idea and I appreciate the emails concerning my progress.Taking the long view, Microsoft set a modern manufacturing trend that only gets worse as time passes. They put out software that did not work and they knew it. Operative policy: Pay full price for an inadequate product, we promise it will get better. Quality standards have continued to be compromised for profit motive. The Fitbit falls into this pattern quite comfortably, it seems. Good idea, too expensive, poor performance, and no recourse for resolution.Look up the meaning of, \"a pig in a poke\".

This little guy is great for tracking my daily movement and even my sleep. I've always wanted to know how restless I am at night and this does that by tracking your movement when in sleep mode. The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't track your heart rate and therefore during workouts when I'm doing movements such as push-ups or mountain climbers, i.e., movements where my arms aren't moving, it can't detect that and therefore won't count it. However, on the app you can log your activities and if you enter in the amount of calories burned, it will then compensate for that on your activity log. Speaking of the activity log, you can also track your food consumption which is amazing. When it comes to diet and exercise my biggest downfall is the diet and with this it tells me how many calories I've consumed/how many more can consume and tracks consumption of protein, fiber, sodium, etc. All in all I give this little tracker a 4 out of 5.

I have been happy with it until today. First, I have been trying to lose weight and with the information this provides, it has helped me to be more concious of what I eat and how active I am.First off, this is not magic device that will guarantee you lose weight. It provides information and the motivation, the determination comes from you.It tracks your activity level (number of steps - not stairsteps climbed though) to a reasonable degree of accuracy. I took a short walk with phone in one hand and the fitbit flex on the other. The counter increased for every step I took, walking, running and jogging. I'm sure its not 100% accurate but maybe with 5% margin for error.You can interact with the fitbit by taps or a bluetooth smart phone (Apple or Android) or through your PC via the included USB dongle.Two taps on the flex activates up to 5 white led lights to show how much of the goal you set has been achieved for the day, 20% per led light. This can be set to display goals through the app - calories burned, steps taken, distance traveled etc.  The flex vibrates when you achieve a daily goal.By steadily tapping it 5x, the lights flash to indicate it is starting to track your sleep pattern (you can initiate this through your phone too). Although I keep forgetting to do this and I am not really interested in tracking my sleep. The few times i tried it though, I got data about my restless times and time I woke up during the night. Don't know what to make of it or what use it is for though.One of the features I love is the vibrating alarm. Set it on your phone and the flex will vibrate at the correct time to wake you and not the person beside you. Great for couples who have to be up at different times and an alarm clock/phone is an unwelcome intrusion into your partner's sleep.  For the guys who had to get up earlier than their girlfriends, the fitbit is worth it if just for saving you from a sleep deprived PMS induced rage a couple of times a month.There is a meal tracker built in the app and it has a pretty extensive database plus the ability to input custom food. Input what you eat from there so the app can compare your calories eaten and burned - the flex tracks the burned calories and is synced to your phone. I have been targeting a calorie deficit of around 1000 calories a day. It is still a hit and miss affair - I love to eat and I can't believe how many calories there are in a pizza. But with this info i have shed 10 lbs since I started using this.Now the bad part, I obviously love my flex but the strap broke after a month. The transparent window for the fitbit flex lights separated from the rubber/silicone strap. I am not an overly active person. I used it in the gym once - to track the distance traveled it measured vs the treadmill (it was within 1/10 over a 3km run). And I took the fitbit device out maybe 4 or 5 times for charging. So I am a little pissed it's broken. The thing that grinds my gears though is the replacement straps are on back order on the fitbit.com website, 8-10 weeks and some jerk is selling them at USD100 for a 3pack here at amazon vs USD30ish for 3 from fitbit.I hope instead of sending me a large AND small strap with the flex (i ordered large) they should have sent me 2 large straps. At least I can still use it while waiting for the back ordered replacements.UPDATE: Fitbit emailed me after I placed my order in their website for the replacement straps to confirm it in line with their security policies.  i requested them to cancel it since the 8-10 week waiting period is too long for me as I have located a local seller carrying the strap and I sent them photos of my damaged strap just to show them the issue and hopefully address it in future versions of the product.  They offered to replace the strap without me requesting, demanding or even hinting for it.  Kudos to Kate and the rest of fitbit.com's support team.  I am adding another star for the hassle free interaction with fitbit support.  Hopefully the other star will be added if and when the future straps holds up to daily use.4 stars for functionality but I am taking off 2 stars due to durability issues and difficulty in getting replacements. I updated the review to 3 stars to give credit to the fast response by the fitbit.com support team.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RLWPHMB4VS4X?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_title": "Durability issues"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-05-20", "review_body": "The description made this product sound too good to be true and I was really excited.....then super super disappointed when I realized all it is, is a fanciful disguised pedometer.

Overall, it's ok.Pros:  I like it from the perspective that it is a wristband.  It is small, sporty and looks like a bracelet.  It is slim-lined and not bulky like other activity monitors.  It syncs to my iPhone, iPad and my pc easily and WIRELESSLY (love this function).  The dashboard is easy to read and understand.  You can enter in any activity to the dashboard that the Flex does not monitor (which really is anything other than walking/running).  Provides good information on your sleep patterns.Cons: In regards to \"Active\" minutes...it only tracks walking/running. And it all honestly, not that accurately.  (I have noticed that I will be doing cardio for 40 minutes at the same intensity and it will only log 32 minutes...not sure where the fall off is to this problem.)It does not track biking, climbing stairs (which we all know is much more intense than just walking quickly), not swimming,  (even though the Flex is submersible to 10m) and not weight training.  This is where I am disappointed. It really is an electronic pedometer.  This is where Body Media beats the Flex.  I don't love the bulkiness of the Body Media unit but when it comes to my activities and burning calories, etc. I want to see how hard I am working and getting accurate reads.I haven't really used the food log portion of the dashboard, but I do like the sleep information.  Again, Body Media provides the same.  I read reviews of the UP and wasn't convinced it was any better than the Flex, so...back to the drawing board.  I suppose I might just use my Body Media when I am working out to get an accurate read of my workouts.**If you do decide to purchase the Flex, the armband is NOT difficult to close as reported on other reviews.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Latest update:Charge seems to be holding after a 12+ hour charge.  * at least that is what it seemed like a day ago. Back down to 1/2 again.I am still not impressed with the Active minutes tracking.  My husband and I rode bikes for 3 hours on and off over the weekend...how many active minutes it logged?  0.  I even attached it to my shoe to see if it would register, but it did not.  I did do Zumba yesterday and it did log my steps and activity accurately.Update:  So now I have charged it for the first time and although the lights on the device showed fully charged, when I sync it shows as 1/2 charged.

Once you properly set up your Flex, including stride length, the step counter is very accurate. The sleep tracking seems to be right on with what I actually remember from the night before, plus it tracks unconscious movement. I got my wife one also, and her sleep tracking is also right on with what she remembers from the night before. It also tracks my naps without having to turn on sleep tracking. There is a review saying you no longer need to turn on sleep tracking mode anymore, the Flex automatically knows when you are asleep. But I have not tried that at night.There are also a lot of bad reviews concerning Fitbit customer service, basically they suck at customer service, but as I have had the Flex for about a week, I have not contacted them... yet. I will update this review periodically.The app that you need to use with the Fitbit Flex is an awesome app. It's full of very useful info, and can keep you busy while you research your own activity and sleep. It's also safe. Almost every other app I've looked at, is based out of China, and asks for way to many permissions.  The only reason this does not get 5 stars, is the form of communication between your Flex and your phone, I'm talking about Bluetooth. I am a network engineer and know a significant amount about wireless security. Bluetooth is the most open form of wireless communication. In other words, it is extremely easy to hack. Less experienced hackers will just be able to see all of your fitness tracking and name. But the more experienced will be able to take control of your phone, not to mention see everything you have on your phone. Now it's important to say that newer phones have some form of protection from Bluetooth hackers, but leaving your Bluetooth on everywhere you go is still a little dangerous. There is nothing you can do about the signal coming from your Flex, but that is just your activity info. If you are going to be leaving your Bluetooth on your phone on, then you need to encrypt your phone. This can be done in the security section of your phone's settings menu. Also, make sure your Bluetooth discovery is turned off. The Bluetooth signal coming from your Flex, is a bubble about 20 feet in every direction around you, including through most walls. Keeping these things in mind will help, but always also keep in mind that any wireless communication can be hacked. Don't be paranoid about it because chances are you're not important or rich enough to be a target. But don't put it completely out of your mind either.  But overall, the Flex does exactly what it says it does.

Since I became slightly more serious about working out, I've been disappointed. The most difficult aspect is the accuracy of the steps/distance. Make sure that you nail your stride perfectly when you enter it into your fitbit profile on the website. Even then, their stated accuracy is 90%--WHICH I ABSOLUTELY CAN LIVE WITH--except I'm not seeing that kind of accuracy. All I want to see is the level of accuracy that they sold me on. After I questioned the functionality of my first fitbit and took the step test, they happily replaced it and the experience was very professional. I'm on my 2nd fitbit and it isn't much better.Lets look at the math (which I've reviewed with numerous reps at fitbit): 1 mile = 5280 feet. My pace is 2.25 feet per \"step\". This means that my fitbit should record roughly 2,346 \"steps\" per mile (5280/2.25). So my 3.5 mile workout should yield roughly 7,350 \"steps\" (5280*3.5=18,480; 18,480/2.25= 8,213 @ 90% =7,392) yet I'm always recording somewhere in the neighborhood of 6,500 steps.Today it recorded 6,142 steps and 2.92 miles for a 3.5 mile jaunt. I'm not doing any serious training so I've just accepted the gross inaccuracy and eventually I quit bothering fitbit customer service.

At first, I was fairly impressed when I actually counted my steps and compared it to the Fitbit calculations.  However, it can be very quirky and inaccurate under certain circumstances.  I have mine on my right wrist, and I am right-handed, so I made sure to set it to the \"Dominant\" wrist setting.  But, to get truly accurate readings, your arm really needs to be at your side.  If I'm carrying things around the house, I don't get an accurate count.  If I'm walking through the store, pushing a grocery cart, I don't get an accurate count.  It seriously under counts my steps.  I'd like to send it back and exchange it for the Fitbit One, which I have since heard is more accurate.  However, I didn't realize that Amazon only takes returns on unopened items, and otherwise charges a restocking fee.  And, I'm not sure this is defective.  I think it's just not accurate.  Should have bought this from a Brick &amp; Mortar store.Edited 4/1/2014...Ok, I've been using my Fitbit for a few more days.  Today I was out for several hours and my step count was still really low as, described previously, I don't walk with my hands down at my side.  I'm usually busy doing other things.  I had contacted Fitbit regarding the problem, but the only thing they could say was that it compared to other wrist-trackers on the market....which isn't saying a lot.  I'd really like to return or exchange this thing, but can't.  When I got home this afternoon, and saw that my step count was again very low, I decided to try taking the Flex unit out of the wrist band and I put it in my pocket.  So far, that seems to give me a better step count.  Not sure how it will work that way with the other functions.  But, frankly, after using the Flex for over a week, I'm not confident in the accuracy of the other functions and will probably never use them.  There is an Omron brand clip-on that gets rave reviews.  Check that one out before you decide to buy the Flex.Edited 4/3/2014...I pursued my issues with Fitbit customer service, and this is what they said:  \" Flex will count your steps when you're walking with your arms stationary, as we do want to give you credit for this activity. This includes walking while pushing a stroller or shopping cart, or holding on to a treadmill.  However, because your hands are not moving, your step count may be a bit lower during this activity.\"So, they have finally admitted the count is not accurate unless your arms are down at your side.  I do dispute the fact that it is a \"bit lower.\"  My steps are hardly being counted at all, unless my arm is down at my side.  So, for this reason, I have now lowered my rating to two stars.  I did contact Amazon customer service and explained what was going on.  They are allowing me to return it, without restocking charges, because it is not working as intended.

Upon submission, I received an automatic acknowledgement that my inquiry had been received within 24 hours (9/10/14).  I didn't hear back from them until a week later (9/16/14) with a request for a copy of my receipt (easy since I purchased it on Amazon) and a few other informational items and let me know that my case would be evaluated and they \"may provide a replacement as a measure of good will\".  The following day (9/17/14) I received an email thanking me for providing the requested information and was notified that a new FitBit was being processed...and I just received my replacement today (9/22/14)!!!I have seen a lot of reviews that have complained about the customer service.  While I think the initial response back asking for additonal information took a week and it was still a total bummer that my original one lasted 6 weeks - I don't have any complaints with my overall customer service experience.  I definitely think that that less than two weeks to receive a replacement is pretty awesome!!!  So I bumped my review up to 3 stars because I loved my FitBit before it broke...that being said I have yet to try my new FitBit out but recommend that anyone with an issue should most definitely contact FitBit customer service (especially since the Amazon return policy is only 30 days).

If you have it on your right hand for example and are typing all day long, or reaching your hand across to grab something from your desk, the movement actually tricks the device into thinking you took another step.

First thing that I hate most about it is the fact that if you shake, move, or basically anything that will make it THINK that you're walking, it'll count it as steps. For example typing, writing, and jerking your hand. I Sat all day one day on the computer, ended the day telling me I walked 2-3 miles...uhh I certainly didn't. For this problem I personally keep it in my pocket and only put it on my wrist when I run,but it's a wristband, that's the whole point, I shouldn't be putting it in my pocket! Second, when tracking sleep you CAN'T just go to bed and  automatically know you're sleeping, you have to go on the Fitbit app to start tracking sleep, not to mention you also have to tell your phone when you wake up or it'll keep tracking it as \"restless sleep\". Third, when you want to track and log  your runs or exercise sessions, SAME with the sleeping. CAN'T just go off for a run and expect it to know you were running. You have to inform that you're going to exercise with your phone. YES you can go running without the phone, it'll just increase your steps and active minutes. you CAN log in exercise manually and \"guess\" how long or far you ran. If you want  more accurate log you have to have your phone for that. It CAN track with GPS where you start and end, how many miles, pace, and mile splits, BUT you have to have run with you're phone. To track all that it needs cellar data to know where you start, it WILL keep tracking if you run somewhere with no connection and still know where you ran, but it only will if you start somewhere with cellar data. Tracking how much you eat is pretty accurate, but can be a bit of a pain to log every time you eat. I don't want to make this too long, so I'll end by saying that overall it's all about the Fitbit app, while there's a small tracker that is placed in a piece of plastic.

First it  is inaccurate - I sit in a rocking chair every evening and I believe it is counting the rocking as steps.  For example a couple days ago I walked 2 miles in the morning and went grocery shopping and at the end of the  day it logged over 40,000 steps which couldn't be correct.  In fact I got an alert in the evening that I reached 35,000 steps and then when I went to bed it said I had 40,000 and I did nothing in between but sit on rocking chair and watch TV and logged 5,000 miles in a couple hours.  Secondly, the actual wrist band pulled apart near where the the lights after less than 3 weeks and can't be fixed. I then started using the smaller one and can see it pulling apart already as well.  I have stopped wearing at this point since it is inaccurate and 2nd wristband is about to break.  I want to return but am 12 days past return policy so now I am stuck with $100 item  that doesn't work properly.  Save the money and just buy a cheap pedometer if you want to track your steps and this was definite waste of money", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EN25EX5KBORF?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Inaccurate Tracking - Not Recommended"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-07-03", "review_body": "The fitbit flex is great for tracking normal, everyday activity as long as you are moving forward...Positives: I love the bracelet look and feel because I don't think I could use a clip very effectively. The band is comfortable and fits well around my wrist. I haven't had an issue putting it on myself or having it fall off during use. You just need to make sure it's securely snapped. The charging has been simple and quick and the battery lasts about 4 days, the amount advertised. The app is pretty awesome. I am someone who likes to see immediate results and this definitely gives me that option.The tracking while outside walking or running does seem to be accurate and it makes it fun to try and beat your daily goal. I find myself making more of an effort to get up and move around more, which is exactly what I wanted from the fitbit flex.Negatives: The tracking on a treadmill or while on a stationary machine is non-existent. I typically run on a treadmill and not outside and the fitbit flex does not track any type of stationary movement, despite arm movement or steps taken. The 3D spatial tracking device needs forward movement to properly track your movement so a 3 mile run was tracked as a 1.2 mile run with about 2,000 steps. The way around this is to manually go back into the dashboard and add an activity and input the information about the activity tracked on the machine and the fitbit will make the changes. While this workout is sufficient to solve the problem, it does not seem to jive with the passive tracking nature of the device. I have also found that the app and the dashboard track calories differently. The dashboard will display the correct number of calories burned and the app seems to show more calories or \"projected calories\". The difference isn't huge but when you are tracking your food as well, it makes it difficult to gauge the number of calories you have left to consume if you're just using the app. Also, if you just stand still and swing your arm in a walking motion, the fitbit will track steps, so it does seem very sensitive to that motion.Overall: This is a good device for someone who wants the motivation to get more active throughout the day and just wants an idea of how many calories they burn during a typical 24-hour period. If you're going to use it for running outside or walking, it is a great device to track your movements and get you up and moving. If you want to use it for stationary machines at the gym, I would recommend the fitbit one which clips on to your clothes. It tracks stationary movement more accurately and still gives you the motivation to get up and moving.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL1PSSHEW6KX3?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Great for forward motion but don't stand still!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-09-15", "review_body": "I've had this 8 months now, and I really thought it was cool.

The only thing I actually really like about this thing is the fact that it gets people motivated to exercise, which, lets face it- America really needs. One of the best (and only) features it offers besides being a glorified inaccurate pedometer is the ability to have a silent alarm. Really cool, and perhaps the only reason I would get one. My boyfriend and I have different schedules and this allows him to sleep while I go to school or vice versa.

When you're trying to gage the difference between 10k and 15k steps, its cool to know how many floors you've climbed/descended as well.4. the band shape creates an awkward fit on my wrist.

For example, yesterday my Omron showed that I had taken 747 steps at the end of the day which is about right since for the vast majority of the day I sat at the desk typing on personal and work stuff and at night watching a football game on TV.  As a comparison the FitBit Flex had me at almost 3,200 steps!!!!  747 steps vs. ~3,200 steps is quite a difference.  Those arm movements from typing, drinking, eating and some actual walking really raked up the steps!  I have a goal of 5,000 steps per day, so based on yesterday's results of Omron vs. FitBit Flex I need to reset my FitBit Flex goal to 21,500 steps per day (5,000 x 4.3).", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35XRJDT54UH9I?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 3, "review_title": "Beware of Inaccurate Step Counts"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-05-06", "review_body": "It works!

Coincidentally, I was given a Fitbit Flex for Christmas, so I decided to walk, setting a goal of 85,000 steps a week.  The feedback is tremendously helpful, as is the ability to have others whose progress you can observe and with whom you can compete if you wish.  The first Flex did have some problems with charging.  The cradle was not tight, and it often required using scotch tape to secure it properly.  It stopped working in about three months.I called customer service and suggest anyone call rather than making an on-line request.  The service was great, and I had a new Flex within three days.  It has been totally reliable over the past nine months, and I continue to be motivated to walk.  I am 72 years old, did lose the 30 pounds and walked just over 2,000 miles in 2014, or about 40 miles a week.  Most will not want to walk that much or be able to devote that much time to walking.  It has motivated me to now join a fitness club for more strength development, and energy levels are out the roof even though they were fine previously.  I also have the Fitbit scale and like the way it tracks weight on-line.  It is easy to fool yourself unless you keep a log, and it is helpful to know that you can splurge at times and not gain and to observe when your weight begins to creep up a pound or two.

For me, I only wanted a way to keep better track of my activity and sleep, but I wasn't asking for perfection.  The Flex does a good job, and I wouldn't wish it was any different.  It may be slightly inaccurate, but I didn't need pinpoint accuracy.  If you want to track every step, every calorie, every inch, then this product is not for you.  However, if you want to become more aware of your daily movement, approximate how many calories you burn, and keep better track of your sleep, then this is perfect.I have found it to be perfect.  I wanted a wristband, and the flex is small, unobtrusive, and comfortable.  The wristband is flexible, and the clasp holds well.  The device itself is amazingly tiny and light, and so far quite durable.  It has withstood sweat, sunscreen, seawater, poolwater, the shower, shampoo, etc.Syncing with Fitbit.com is easy, and charging is also easy.  I leave both the wireless dongle and the charging cable attached to my computer all the time.  The website is easy to use, and adaptable.  You can easily change your settings, track your food, input your weight, and modify your daily goals.  The silent alarm is silent and effective, but the only way to enable or disable it is from the computer, which is a little annoying.The star of the show is Fitbit.com's integration with other websites.  I have connected it to my MyFitnessPal account, and am constantly astonished at the seamlessness of the data sharing.  Fitbit shares my activity and calories with MyFitnessPal, and MyFitnessPal shares my food and weight inputs with Fitbit, all without me lifting a finger.  I could not be happier with this feature!The only thing I have found myself wishing was that there was a way to display the time on the Flex.  Even though the screen with the lights is tiny, it could be readable, and I often wish that I knew what time it was, and was wearing a watch as well as the Flex.  However, if adding this would make the Flex any larger, I wouldn't wish it.  Right now it is anything but bulky, but I wear it on the inside of my wrist and it could easily begin to knock on things as I move my arm or use my hand.Overall, it is a great product for me.  Could it be more accurate?  Sure!  Are the step counts sometimes off?  Yes, it's on your arm, not your leg!  Are the calories perfect?  Come on, it doesn't have a heart rate monitor, what are you expecting?  Right now it is pretty accurate, small, comfortable, easy to use, and cheap compared to the Nike Fuelband, more durable than the UP by Jawbone.  I am interested to see whether they can make the Flex more accurate without sacrificing anything, but for now... I think it's perfect, and will continue to wear it until it dies.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R326T1XLGUF02O?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Good for encouragement and approximation"}], [{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-08-05", "review_body": "I have had my Fitbit Flex for about a year and a half.  It has really enabled me to become more active.  Last June I finally decided I needed to get in shape and lose the extra 40 pounds that I have been carrying around for the past three years.  Using the Fitbit to give me an accounting of my steps, the Lose it! app to keep me accountable for my caloric intake, and finding a form of exercise that was fun for me (Just Dance video games) were the key for me in losing the weight.  The combination of all three enabled me to lose the 40 pounds in five months and I have continued to use them in maintaining which I have done now for nine and a half months.  Back to the Fitbit Flex, I downloaded the app on my phone and also keep track on my computer.  I like that you can track not only your steps but also your sleep patterns, water intake, and caloric intake.  Luckily for me the Fitbit syncs with the Lose it! app so all the information I put in gets transferred between the apps.  I like that you can join in challenges with friends and that you get a little pat on the back in the form of a vibration when you reach your goal each day.  I thought seriously about upgrading to the Fitbit Charge but decided against it because I like that I can change the color and look of my band with the Fitbit Flex to coordinate with my outfit or my mood for the day.  Another thing that I really like about the Fitbit Flex is the fact that I can set an alarm.  I hate waking up to the sounds of beep-beep-beep...beep-beep-beep, you get the idea.  With the Fitbit Flex I can set an alarm to wake up in the morning and instead of waking up in a startling manner, I get a light vibration on my wrist which is a much nicer way to wake up in my opinion.

It's a convenient way to track my daily activity.  I've found that knowing how many steps I've taken in a day is a useful motivator if I'm being sedentary for some reason and am lagging behind my \"goal\" of 10,000 a day.In terms of usability, the Fitbit is great.  It is small, lightweight, and unobtrusive. It's comfortable to wear.  Initially I had some misgivings about the lack of information that the device itself can display.  The Nike FuelBand, for instance, can display steps taken and other metrics on the band itself. With Fitbit, this information is mostly displayed in the App or on the dashboard.  Since everyone has a smartphone these days, this really does not turn out to be a significant limitation.  After a few days I learned to just let the Fitbit count my activity and I check up on it in the app when I want.  The device has 5 LEDs that show progress toward 10,000 steps (each one represents 2,000 steps), and it turns out that's all the information you really need.The step counting appears fairly accurate.  There is an option to set the sensitivity of the Fitbit based on whether you're wearing it on your dominant hand, the theory being that you use your dominant hand more, so if you're wearing the Fitbit on that hand, it should be less sensitive. I wear mine on my non-dominant hand but have the dominant hand setting selected because I felt otherwise the Fitbit was overcounting my steps.  The calorie and distance estimations seem undercounted to me, but those aren't why you really would use this type of device.The most disappointing thing about the Fitbit to me is the sleep tracking function.  It doesn't seem particularly accurate.  Fitbit thinks I am pretty sound sleeper, but there are nights where I've slept terribly and the Fitbit doesn't seem to pick up on it. The sleep tracking display is also very binary (trinary?) - either you're \"asleep,\" \"awake,\" or \"restless\" - but other sleep measurement devices are better at detecting both these states and the varying gradations between them.Anyway, I love the Fitbit for what it does well, and hope that with software updates they can hone it further to do other stuff better!", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UMXJDZA1ITHU?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Great way to measure activity"}], [{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-08-17", "review_body": "I don't have the black band, however I do have the fitbit flex.It comes with two sizes of wrist bands, which is great that adjust to many different sizes, which is good, because I have small, almost child size wrists, and it fitsI love that it records my sleep and physical activity - it evens lets me know if my activity is considered 'intense.'The only thing I don't like is that it didn't work with Weight Watchers and I couldn't find how to convert data, finally came across fitwatchr and it works great!The module's power lasts a week and charges easily,Worth it??

I think they should redesign the flex with a similar clasp.Second, It often is knocked into sleep mode by vibrations such as operating power tools (I suspect using a lawnmower will cause the same problem).  Also it usually requires about 10 seconds of very forceful tapping to put it into or out of sleep mode.

I've had it come off after getting hooked on something in my gym bag--I didn't even notice it at first--thankfully it fell into my bag and not on the street somewhere.

You can measure water consumption and your weight which is nice if you're trying to track or run metrics against it.

Having owned other Fitbit products, I will say that it is my favorite thus far. I purchased this when I realized I had lost my Ultra after walking to a friends house. The wristband design solves this issue and makes it very difficult to lose the product while wearing it.Its sleep function is much more user friendly than the Ultra. A few repeated taps causes it to enter sleep tracking mode.  This is much simpler than the velcro wristband included with the ultra and requires hardly any thought.Let me address the concerns of some other reviewers.  Unlike the ultra the flex relies on five led lights to indicate progress towards your daily goal. The Ultra relies on a small screen with a readout.  This allows the Ultra to provide more information directly from the device, however, this information is limited and requires a sync to a computer to get more detailed info. The Flex is capable to syncing to a smart phone to provide real time data when desired. I found this much more convenient than the small screen on the Ultra.Also, some reviewer have complained that the wristband is difficult to close.  After wearing the wristband practically 24/7 (with exceptions for swimming, showering, and charging) I can say that the wristband becomes much easier to get on and off with time, yet doesn't show any sign of wear or tear.I mentioned charging above.  I have found that charging through the USB cable from completely dead to full takes less than the three hours listed in the instructions.  The claim of five days of batter life seems accurate.As some reviewers have mentioned, there is no altimeter for stairs. Sorry to tell those Ultra lovers out there, but the altimeter on the ultra wasn't accurate. I tested it walking the twelve flights of stairs to my floor in my office building.  Not once did it accurately record the correct number of floors. Really, the altimeter isn't a big loss.  It was simple \"feature creep\" on the ultra.In summary, the Flex is a great product for someone looking to get in shape. If you are a smartphone user, I would highly recommend it.  The function is simple, the wristband is slim (between a livestrong bracelet and a small watch), and it integrates well with apps like my fitness pal. I have been pleased with its performance.  It encourages me to make small additions to my fitness (taking the stairs instead of the elevator and walking a slightly longer but more scenic rout home), which is one of the main motivations for wearing a pedometer.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSEVFMMGURWRQ?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Simple, yet functional"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-09-27", "review_body": "This device functioned fine for approximately eight weeks.

Not only is software QA poor, hardware QA is nonexistent. The Fitbit support team is abysmal. They don't actually read your support requests. They look at a couple key words, then send a cookie cutter response that may or may not have ANYTHING to do with whatever you asked about. It takes 4-5 back and forth emails until you happen to get someone who happens to read the right part of the message you send to understand why their cookie cutter emails don't actually address the problem you're having. Once that's done, they get about actually offering a replacement product. The only positive thing I can say is that they are so aware of how bad their hardware quality is, they replace the product no questions asked. I had to talk them into giving me a return shipping label for all my broken trackers. I wanted them to have some bad ones to look at so they can get to the bottom of their manufacturing and hardware problems.At least now I have a bunch of extra bands from all the replacement trackers.Update: I lowered my initial review from 4 stars to 2. Here's why:1. The band only lasts about 4 months. The rubber gets too soft, so the clasp stops staying as secure. the sides also start bulging out around the tracker from the tension on the wristband, and it eventually tore around the plastic part. Fitbit replaced the band, no questions asked, which leaves me wondering if this is a known problem or not. I doubt I'll get another replacement, but hopefully something better will come along by then. I definitely wouldn't trust the Force wristband.2. Software QA is poor. Their software has been getting progressively more buggy/less stable since September. The tracker no longer reliably syncs in the background, and I've been having issues with setting silent alarms, with the iOS software showing that silent alarms synced, when they actually didn't. The newest update stopped even pretending to work with silent alarms for me. I've tried restarting my phone, reinstalling the Fitbit app, and completely resetting my phone and the tracker.3. When you email support about software problems, they don't actually read the contents of your message. Having already taken, and having mentioned taking, all their \"troubleshooting\" steps, the CSR told me to do what I had already done. When I responded that I had already done those things and wanted to file a bug report, not ask for support, I got an entirely new person who told me to do the same thing.Original review:I've been wearing a fitbit flex for about a month. I initially purchased the fitbit to track sleep quality. As a geek, I like quantifiable data, and I have a sleeping disorder called \"graduate school.\"I had some pairing issues, but they were due to my own impatience. Response from the fitbit to the smartphone and back is slow, give it time. I can't wear wristwatches because I find them itchy and uncomfortable, but haven't had any problems with the fitbit flex band. I only remove it when I need to charge the fitbit.For the most part, the device does what it promises. It tracks steps, records \"highly active\" time spent every day and notifies you when you hit your goal.Sleep tracking is ok as a relative comparison between nights, but doesn't mean much in the absolute sense. The regular mode is too insensitive and the high sensitivity mode is too sensitive. If you lie still while awake, you can \"trick\" it into thinking you are sleeping. Qualitatively, it tells you whether or not you are giving yourself enough time to sleep start-to-finish and how frequently you're waking up. The duration of awake periods, and how it calculates time spent asleep are a bit dubious.The fitbit software will also compare calories in to calories burned. Unfortunately, their system can only do weight loss or weight maintenance. If you're trying to gain weight, you'll need another tool. I currently use myfitnesspal for food logging because it has a much more comprehensive database and does allow for weight gain goals. I've probably gotten the most constructive feedback from this because it tells me exactly how much I'm under-eating by for my given activity level (2-3 hours/day of heavy activity, 18,000 steps/day average), and I have tried to adjust my lifestyle habits accordingly. In the same time period, I've managed to shave &gt;15s/mile off my distance runs. I don't have enough data to attribute it to primarily diet, or regular training improvements, but giving a number is a good reminder to 1, eat, and 2, pick appropriate foods. I can't comment on the effectiveness of the fitbit Aria scale, but I'd like to pick one up eventually.My favorite feature is probably the silent alarm. It's very good at waking me up without being annoying like audible alarms.Things I'd like to see:The fitbit isn't designed for runners. There are two main issues. First, run logging is poor. The fitbit collects all this data, but when you log a run, it promptly ignores what it measured. The workaround I've found is to set an unnamed \"activity\" between a start and stop time. The fitbit app will pull steps from that. Logging a run any other way results in less real data being shown. One interesting thing to note is that calorie burn estimates between fitbit and runkeeper are extremely close.Distance estimate works reasonably well for walking and for running at the pace you calibrated it to. The distance estimate is close for steady state runs, but is off by as much as 20% for anything faster, like tempo runs or workouts. I haven't done too much research into this I'd like to see fitbit add some sort of multi-point stride length vs cadence model so it can estimate stride length better for runs. One strength the fitbit does have, however, is because it doesn't rely on GPS, it works much better than a smartphone+runkeeper at tracking distances on winding trail runs. My measured distance agreed with the official measurement for a 5 mile trail race within +/- 0.1 miles.The food and exercise database is not good. I use myfitnesspal to track food and activities, but I'd like to be able to use just one smartphone app.Reminders. Reminders to eat. Reminders to sleep. Reminders to move.

The manufacturer assumes we are all perfectly intuitive people and able to navigate the usefulness of the device without complete instructions that incidentally DO NOT come with the device.If you want to lose weight and depend on calorie count on the device to help you along in your assessments read on. The aspect of calorie count used by you and counted against your calorie burn and the logging in of your calories consumed is hard work. Essentially you do not know the caloric makeups of non-packaged food. So when you make your own meals the task of building up a meal from the scratch ingredients to come to a calorie value is a long slog that one gets tired of quickly. The company should have hundreds more standard home meals on their list of selections not just store purchased microwave dinners and the like. The company should open up up some recipe books like Real Simple and build a meal listing and the published calorie count associated with those meals, etc. and that would be a start.As an example you make a cup of coffee at home with non-dairy creamer and one teaspoon of sugar, this should be on a selection list rather than you having to construct this calorie count from scratch and then enter it. Another example would be 1-chicken breast cooked in olive oil with a side of spinach and medium baked potato.Other issues:I walk up and down steps in my home many times a day but the step count on the device indicates no steps taken. Does not work.One other aspect of this device that was unknown prior to purchase is that this item can provide more information for you about your activities if you want to have it at a cost.

You can also get other data about your activity (expect for flights of stairs - no altimeter) from your dashboard, but that's not near as convenient as being able to spot check as you go.All-in-all the Flex is fine for tracking your activity - on the dashboard - but not real good for spot checking how you are doing as your day progresses.

The week I had the device it definitely encouraged me to increase my water consumption, decrease my food consumption, and increase my exercise. I loved, loved meeting my goals and seeing the graphs and looked forward to weighing each morning (I also purchased the aria fitbit scale to go with the fitbit flex and this made the whole process more fun (I know, imagine having fun weighing yourself).The problems though put a definite damper on the whole process.  One, the tracking devices were a tad inaccurate.  The app always under registered the time I exercised, and the steps I was taking.  This I could live with though, because after all, I was increasing the time and the steps and the device did definitely encourage me.  The real problem was the band on the device.  This band is extremely, extremely difficult  to attach.  I was having so much fun though that once I got it attached I left it on my wrist (holding my hand over the side of the tub so it wouldn't get wet, trying to wash dishes one handed, that's how difficult it was to get attached so that I didn't want to take it off because who knew how long it would take to get attached again).  Yes, this is ridiculous for a woman to do this with a $100 device. Fitbit really should have designed this better.  And then it came off when I was unaware and I have now lost it.

How does it work? Is it accurate? will i become fitter? were the questions i was asking. I have only had it for about a month and it is my best purchase to date. I went on a run on a treadmill for 2kms to see if it had the same distance on the fitbit. it was actually spot on. Mind blown! The next test was a quick walk to my mate house. 1700 steps later i was there. 1700 steps on my fitbit were added bringing me that much closer to my daily goal. i was pretty impresed at this point and i had only had it for a few hours. the next test was doing push ups, and what a waste of a test, a total of 0 steps were taken while doing 20 pushups. My daily goal was not any closer. The sun was setting by this point and i was still 4000 steps from my goal. Dinner time was tense, i was constantly double tapping my fitbit watching the 5 leds light up and then flashing saying i had only done 60% of my daily steps. It was the first day I had it and i was going to let it down already. An after dinner walk with my dog brought me up to 8000 steps, 80% of my goal. It was dark now and it seemed that all hope was fading. I decided to do the dishes and ponder over the shame i will bring to myself if I do not complete my steps. my arm movement in the sink added a few hundred steps to the tally but that was not enough. the waterproofing of the band was an added bonus i almost forgot about. a quick walk around the block before i would go to sleep would surely push me over the edge by now. i was only a few hundred steps away from my goal and it was almost midnight. at 9800 steps i decided to call it quits. time for bed. halfway through brushing my teeth my arm starts to vibrate, a celebratory dance of flashing led lights and pleasing vibrations coming from my toothbrush arm signaled to me that i had won. 10000 steps had been done that day and i could go to bed with a smile on my face ready for the next day.the next day came out of nowhere. bzzzz bzzzz bzzzz startled me at 7:00 am. i looked over to my alarm clock to smack it on the head but no... the alarm was not on. bzzz bzzzz bzzzz again. coming to my senses at this point i realised the silent alarm function on my fitbit was working. the sheer joy of not being woken up by the shrill screach of the monotone alarm made me jump out of bed immediately. the running shoes were on by 7:10 and i was out the door with a banana in my stomach going on a run by 7:15. a few laps around the oval and back home by 7:45. i was buzzing with energy for the rest of the day. by dinner time i was getting push notification off my phone congratulating me for outdoing my daily goal by 2500 steps. i could go to bed smiling once again.while showing off my fitbit to the family the next day. they were so excited by the sleep log that they all wanted to try it out and have a go at seeing how they sleep.i am still trying to get them to buy one so i can compete against them and become the true alpha male of the household.i would consider buying a fit bit for sure if i did not have one already.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CE43F0K500FD?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "from sceptical to fanboy"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-03-16", "review_body": "I wore this 24/7 for the first 4 months then switched to only at the gym, at night, and on weekends.

I'm on my FOURTH fitbit.  I had two Fitbit One units, and two Fitbit Flex units... the ones I just lost.  Then the two flexes were lost because the bracelets came apart after a few months of use - the last one just happened a few days ago.  It's always the rubber part of the wristband where it meets the black plastic window that shows you the indicator lights.  I usually catch this and replaced the rubber wristband twice... but the first time I didn't catch it... must have put my hand in my pocket, pulled it out, the band broke and it fell off... it's so light you won't notice it missing.  The second time, the same thing... I went through security at a courthouse, took it off, put it back on, noticed the hard plastic was just beginning to separate from the rubber and made a mental note to be careful (I had an extra band at home, so I could make it until then) and while walking around it fell off... I noticed in a period of about 15 minutes but by then it was gone.  Ran around the courthouse tracing every step and asking every officer, and it was long gone.Soooo... what would make this better? Rather than a rubber band to put the sensor INSIDE, why not just have the sensor have something you can put it in with two holes punched in the ends (think of a watch and watchband) where we could just attach any watchband we want?  Watchbands are very popular, there are millions of them, just make this backward compatible... plus a lot of people might end up buying this if they can use their expensive leather/gold/steel/alligator/whatever watch bands?I really hope someone from fitbit is reading this... I have the scale, and have bought 4 fitbits for myself and 1 for another person... would be great to have this replaced because it really was the broken band that caused this to become lost.  I actually love the products, love knowing my vitals as much as possible.  Again, it'd be awesome to have this replaced... I really do believe in the product, but this just gets me down.As a suggestion for the device itself:  perhaps learn waking patterns like movement...

Now, it's mostly become a conversation piece and whenever someone asks I have lots of reasons to tell them it's not worth it.When I first got it, I was excited and started tracking. It was useful in helping me realize that even though I'm pretty active in general, I am nowhere near as active as I thought. So it prompted me think about ways to incorporate a little more walking into my day and to get a feel for what my commute should look like if I want to hit my 10,000 steps. After that, the value add was pretty minimal which was fine because about 2 weeks in, the band split in half and I wasn't able to use it. I did email Fitbit and after making me take and label photos, they promised to send a new one within 7-10 business days. Maybe I'm spoiled by Amazon Prime, but that seemed like a ridiculous amount of time to wait for a replacement.I do use RunKeeper to track my runs and was most inspired to get on the wait list for the Flex after seeing a post that said the two could be synced. And that's one of my biggest disappointments. You can pull FitBit data into RunKeeper, but not the other way around. So backwards if the idea is to track all of my activities in FitBit -- I don't want to track my every day steps in my running app.Another thing that missed the mark for me is activity and calorie tracking. They have placeholders for them, but there's no real integration with the actual tracker. I think it assumes I burn a certain number of calories just based on my height/weight so my log shows me burning the same amount for days I didn't even wear it. It might make slight adjustments based on my total steps, but it doesn't really account for any difference in steps when I'm walking or running. Any activity beyond walking and sleeping needs to be manually entered.I don't ever go to the website dashboard, but it seems (based on a few surveys I received) like they've put more energy into that than the mobile app, which is a shame. For a brief period, I was using the food and water tracker via the iOS app, but the food search gets a bit wonky and hard to use. I was interested in tracking my sleep and did find it somewhat interesting to see that information...if only they did a little more to help educate me on what is normal.I am currently not wearing it because it's stopped taking a charge.

I had to wait a month for delivery because I was a late comer to this item.As my title says it is a great motivator for working out and eating healthy. I synced it to my phone and track my progress all day long. I downloaded the MyFitnessPal app and it syncs with the Fitbit app. The combination of the two apps is a great snapshot of your fitness/eating progress. The sleep tracking is also pretty good. On the phone app it will say 15X awakened but when you look at your fitbit snapshot online it will break it down to 2X awakened and 13X restless. The silent alarm function is also very good.I comapred the step counter to another one I have a Virgin Healthmiles Gozone. I have the GoZone in my pocket and the Fitbit on the wrist. The Fitbit registered about 1000 more steps. The Fitbit is comfortable to wear. I personally wear it on my non dominant arm.Okay, now to the reason I only gave it 4 stars. My wrist strap ripped after 2.5 weeks of use. I wore it everyday and only took it off to wipe the water out of the Fitbit holder. It ripped at the clear plastic and rubber junction. The second reason is sleep mode. The Fitbit can be very temperamental going into sleep mode. There are some nights that I have to constantly tap to put it in sleep mode. Then there are times when it goes into sleep mode quite easily. One instance I can remember was when I clapped at a choir performance and it vibrated and went into sleep mode just from clapping. It happened three times during that concert. The third reason is sometimes the Fitbit app sometimes will not update. As I write this review I updated the Fitbit app on my phone and it just gives me the updating symbol. If I restart the phone it usually fixes it.All in all this is a great product.

Many other days I'm amazed to see I've walked the 10,000 steps they put as the goal. (By the way once you reach the 10,000 steps for the day, the flex stops counting - which in itself is pretty annoying). Recently, I decided to get the Fitbit Zip and compare its \"steps\" at the same time as the \"flex.\" To start with I had to create a separate account/email for it since Fitbit can't handle more than one device per account. Today I wore both, from morning to night. Currently it shows I took 8,018 steps on my Flex and 6,650 steps on my Zip. There is absolutely NO QUESTION to me that the Flex has serious inaccuracies -- since I have watched it in real time count almost any significant hand movement (driving etc) as steps. Btw, I wear the Flex on my non-dominate hand as this was a suggestion to help with these errant movement counts. But it is still WAY off... I think there may be an inherent problem with wearing a device on your wrist that's meant to measure your steps. My Zip, which I had clipped to my waistband all day was certainly the more accurate.

I am shocked and disappointed at the high marks this thing is getting.I'm an avid walker and I have tested a number of pedometers. I also **calibrate** mine by walking a 1/4 mile track. I am very familiar with steps and how many it takes to walk 1 mile - about 2000. So 10,000 means you've walked 5 miles.The first day I wore this, I put it on, jumped in my car, drove for *3 hours*, 2 short pits stops, got to my first destination and walked at most 1/4 mile, back in my car, to the hotel, walked up to the room and whammo!! congrats on your 10,000 steps. Walking as fast as I can, which is about 15 minute mile, I have to walk 1 hour and 15 minutes to walk 5 miles. I walked no more than 30 minutes that day. There was no way this could be right. The next day, same thing. It recorded 10,000 steps when I knew clearly I had not walked 5 miles that day. The third day, I got back in the car and drove home and same thing - recorded 10,000 steps when I knew I hadn't gone anywhere near that far.So then I tested the FitBit against my calibrated device. As soon as the FitBit rewarded me for going 10,000 steps, my real device had me at 2,500. Not even close.I cannot recommend this.

However, the clasp on mine was not very secure.  Today, I looked down and the Flex was gone.  It being so comfortable, I did not notice that it had fallen off.  I will say that it may have just been my fault, but, with something in this price range, I made sure that I pressed down on the clasp each and every time I put it on a left the house.For that reason, I cannot recommend the Flex; at least not because of the potential, easy loss of your investment.

Either my charger is defective and no longer charging the unit, or something is wrong with the device itself; maybe the battery stopped working.Aside from it not lasting very long for me, this is a great device overall. If your goal is to become more active, this will definitely help. It helps you define a clear goal (the default goal is 10,000 steps walked per day which can be changed through the Fitbit website) and try to reach it every day. There are some pros and cons for this specific device, from my experience, in my own opinion.Pros:+Helps track activity throughout the day+Companion website is great, you can track calories/water on their website or you can import calories consumed from a different smartphone app.+Good motivation+Can be showered/bathed with; waterproof up to a certain depth.+When it holds a charge, it lasts for several days. I only had to recharge it a bit more than once a week, maybe every 5-6 days.Cons:-If you don't move your Fitbit holding arm while walking/moving (i.e. you're holding something in your hand, hand is in pocket, etc.) then it won't monitor any steps.-Activities other than walking/jogging/running must be manually added on the website-Some activities (such as using the elliptical) have a very inaccurate means for being manually added (i.e rather than putting in the amount of revolutions completed in the given time frame you would rate the intensity of the workout as light/medium/difficult)-The sleep monitoring aspect of this device is not very accurate. It takes me a long time to actually fall asleep and I'll lay still in bed for a while and the next day on my sleep it'll say I was asleep but rolling around even though I wasn't asleep yet.-My device stopped working after only a couple months of use.-For those who don't yet have smartphones with Bluetooth 2.0, the only way you get feedback is tapping it twice and seeing the blinking lights. There are 5 lights maximum, each blinking light represents 20% of your goal (1-20%, 2-40%, 3-60%, 4-80%, 5-100%). It's better than no feedback, but for how much the device costs it could be a bit better, maybe displaying the exact number of steps taken and the time so that it's like a fit watch (I'm waiting for the next version of the Fitbit Force).All in all, this product has some pros and cons. If anybody ends up reading my review, it's up to you if you feel the money is worth the investment. Based on my experience with the device which I had, I'd recommend either buying Fitbit One because it's less expensive and does essentially the exact same thing, except it'll actually tell you how many steps you've taken, or waiting for the new Fitbit Force to come out (Force was recalled because of skin irritation, they're coming out with an updated safer version or a product with a different name). As I mentioned, my device stopped working after a couple months, so personally I'm not going to buy another Flex but I may have just gotten a defective device. I still have faith in the company, but I do find it unfortunate that my product didn't last long, so I'm giving it one star because what I received was an expensive pedometer which didn't last long enough to be worth the purchase.UPDATE 7/20/2014:I was thinking about buying another pedometer-wristband device but I didn't want to give up on my Flex so I looked online for some solutions. When my Flex's tracker was in the charging dock, it wouldn't flash any lights or give any indication of charging. I cleaned the connectors on my charger and tracker with some rubbing alcohol, and I noticed small pieces of corrosion or something on the tracker's end so I gently scraped that off with a pin. I used the reset button on the charger twice and now my Fitbit works again! As a side-note, I have a new cellphone now which is bluetooth compatible with the Flex and the app is quite good. I upgraded my review from 1 star to 3 stars since my device is working again.I feel like the Flex had good potential and will help them pave the way for Fitbit Force, but I feel like Flex doesn't really have any advantages over the One or Zip even though it's significantly more expensive. One and Zip both have the ability to actively display the steps, calories burned, etc. on LCD displays. The technology to give the Flex an LCD display has been here but instead I feel Fitbit played it safe with the Flex so they could have it compete with Jawbone UP and the Nike Fuel thing. It's not a huge deal that I have to look at my cell phone and open the app to look at my steps, but in hindsight I feel like I should've bought the One or Zip because it's just more practical to be able to see my steps in real time on the device tracking my steps rather than relying on my cell phone or computer to see how I've been doing. In my eyes the Flex is a step backwards from where the One and Zip were, and being able to keep the Flex on my wrist 24/7 is a disadvantage compared to getting rid of the LCD display with real-time step count.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AKO647RI8J0U?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 3, "review_title": "It Was Great While It Lasted!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-03-28", "review_body": "After using this for 2 months, it broke!

After my first day with the device I have to say I am underwhelmed.  The design is cumbersome and it appears someone just got tired of thinking in the middle of the engineering process.  Set up is relatively easy but your information is either tethered to your phone or your computer.  Too bad they didn't make the band a bit wider and include a data display on it.  If I have to sync with a phone or computer to see how I am doing, then I will just use the free fitness app that comes with my Android.  So if you are out trying to get to your step goal, you won't know where you are until you consult your phone or computer.The wireless sync dongle that comes with the kit is very small, has no wrist band or loop to hang or attach the dongle to something and it is likely to get lost soon after you unwrap the fitbit.  To charge the unit you have to remove the tracker from the band to do so.  Could no one figure out how to recharge the unit while still assembled?The band is difficult to close and is likely to fall off if you don't get lucky in attaching it. Surely there is a better way to attach the band--like the old buckle method or a plain old stretch band.Finally I have my doubts about the accuracy of the counter.

The unit was working and charging as described via USB then suddenly after recharge it wouldn't hold a charge. I contacted customer service and was ecstatic that they would send me out a replacement right away!I got my replacement flex, followed the instructions to replace it on my dashboard and charged it up via USB on my computer. I put it on the next morning and it died 2 and 1/2 hours later. I thought maybe it just hadn't gotten charged like it should have so I left it on the usb charger over night and put it on the next morning only this time it didn't register ANY steps or give me any lights.I contacted customer service yet again and they determined that the second unit I got was defective and sent me out a THIRD unit.Again I followed all instructions and JUST IN CASE there was something wrong with the usb port I was charging on I hooked it up to a different one. I charged the unit for a few hours until it said full, and put it on. It seemed to be working FINALLY. It went one whole day tracking everything just fine, I used the sleep mode fine, woke up the next day and was wearing it all day. Went to bed again the next night and put it into sleep mode from which it never woke up. No lights, no steps counted, and when I plug it in to charge it gives me one light. It will charge to all 5 lights and then when taken off and tapped, it does NOTHING. Putting it back on the charger results in it showing ONE LIGHT again.I have reset each of these units per the instructions on the website as well to no avail.At this point I'm not sure I even want to TRY to contact customer service because it seems like all they do is send me out yet another defective unit!

Caput. Toast. Worthless. Shot. After tree months of use. I initially purchased the Fitbit Flex because use of this product was promoted by my health insurance provider, which monitored my exercise patterns via the Fitbit online dashboard software and, if I met certain fitness goals, rewarded my medical coverage Visa debit-card with money that could be used for co-pays, office visits, etc. etc., up to $1000.00 per year. So, since I workout a lot, it made perfect sense for me to buy the device. I used the Fitbit specifically and strictly as instructed, recharging the battery every five days, without any difficulty for the first two months. I averaged about 65,000 steps a week since wearing the device. I never wore it in the shower. The battery never got wet. I didn't use the battery to prop-up an uneven table-leg, or anything ridiculous. It just started going haywire in terms of \"taking a recharge\" before Christmas. Sometimes it would charge easily. Then, the next week it would charge (indicated by the green \"fully charged\" indicator on the online dashboard) but, the very next day, the battery would be low or near-dead. Thereafter, the thing might charge again for three days. Or maybe two. Or four. And then back to two. There were no obstructions in the charging unit or in the battery's anodes. I ordered a new charger, in case that was the problem. It wasn't. Different electrical outlets, of course, were tried, just to be sure. That wasn't the problem. The device just gave-out and died completely after a couple weeks of erratic functionality.I definitely enjoyed the Fitbit while it worked, but let's face it: you pay $99.00 for what is essentially nothing but a very rudimentary, very basic odometer and motion-sensor unit. The online software that receives and interprets the raw \"motion-detected\" data is FREE, and this online dashboard is the only cool thing about the product whatsoever ... and it isn't even really part of the actual product you paid for. Of course, the software, too, becomes useless if your $99.00 odometer just suddenly up-and-dies after only three months of use. Looking at nearly 2,000 crappy reviews, here on Amazon, I was irritated to discover that I am hardly alone in my experience of this rip-off product's tendency to konk-out after several weeks or 2-3 months. And, of course, after having the thing for three months, it is not returnable.You know, I get it. It's a money-grab. These things are probably made in China at a production-cost of a few bucks per digitalized battery-unit and maybe a few cents for the rubber wrist-band. If these things lasted even a year at $99.00-a-pop, I might be inclined to call it worthwhile, in my circumstances. But barely three-months before you have to buy a brand new one? Forget that!

I've had this all of 36 hours and I'm already MADLY in love with it.  It tracks everything, plays nicely with other fitness apps, syncs in REAL TIME, I love the silent alarm... everything about this is FANTASTIC.I will update this review later with a more in-depth glance at everything, but off the start, everything is very clear, very simple, the dashboard is eloquent, the app for this product is great.  Having tried (and hated) another product (Polar Loop), I think I've found a winner.IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO HIT THE \"PURCHASE\" BUTTON- A WORD OF ADVICE: You'll want to look up a silicone fastener ring for fitbit- I'll link it here if this will let me.  The version I bought had about 10 rings in a package for about ten bucks... you're about to buy a decently priced fitness band, it's worth the ten dollar investment for the extra silicone fasteners, and here's why:Before buying this product, I read some horror stories about \"I bought it, loved it, it fell off, and I don't know where and I'm devastated.\"  Thinking it was just a once-in-a-blue-moon occurrence, I bought one.Within the first two hours of wearing it, the band came off twice.  It's extremely lightweight, so the only way I noticed was when I heard something hit the floor.I wasn't doing anything strenuous, it just fell off, which is weird, because it's not exactly easy to fasten, but it's apparently really easy to come un-done.I got onto google, searched a minute or two, and found this- a simple, eloquent solution to a design flaw that will save you from losing a somewhat-pricey wrist band.THIS IS THE ONLY BEEF I HAVE WITH THE PRODUCT.  That said, I still HIGHLY recommend it if you're trying to get on a good fitness track- I just also highly recommend taking the steps to ensure you don't lose it, because that would ruin my day, and I'm sure it would ruin your's also.If it will let me, the link to the product I bought:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7TOUYU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Doesn't have to be that one, but you'll want something similar.Other than that, a great product!

I personally own the Charge, Zip, and One. I bought the Flex for my 11 year-old daughter. While it is great for her, as a Mom, I don't recommend ANY activity trackers that you wear on your wrist.Why? Because when pushing a grocery cart or a stroller, your steps WILL NOT register because your arms aren't moving. I wore my Zip and Charge and the same time and went grocery shopping, while pregnant and pushing my then 3 year-old in a cart + the groceries. I had a 1000+ difference between the 2 trackers! That's a HUGE difference for a grocery trip. The Zip (worn at my waist) was way more accurate.Also, I started noticing that on Mondays, my steps went way up wearing a Charge. Reason...It's our laundry day and I am constantly folding clothes AND MOVING MY ARMS - NOT MY FEET.Back to the Flex...It's a great intro Fitbit for your child. They are popular and kids want to wear them. I see my kids competing with their friends and relatives. It's a great way to get kids moving and keep them moving. HOWEVER, If you want an accurate one, try the One. It does everything the Flex does, plus you can track your sleep and stair flights. (I am for 25 flights of stairs a day! It makes a HUGE difference in my calories burned, even if I don't get 10,000 steps in.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BBNUO3AO9S2H?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_title": "Great for my kids - not for me."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-01-26", "review_body": "I'm not normally one to fall in love with a little gadget, but this is one that I really enjoy.  First, let's start with the fitbit itself.  It is a simple band that contains a removable pedometer (you remove it to charge it once a week).  It is about the width of the Livestrong band that I have worn for years, but a bit thicker.  In terms of style it is unobtrusively plain and won't draw attention to your arm.The band itself uses a system of snaps where two posts go into a slot.  Although it can be a bit hard to get on, once it's on it will NOT fall off.  I've used mine through vigorous exercise and banged it on things and it stays right in place.  Although I think the band could be improved there aren't nearly as many problems as some reviewers would have you think.  The package comes with both a small and large band.In terms of accuracy, it certainly does an excellent job of counting steps.  I've tested it while swinging my arm, while not swinging my arm, while driving, etc.  It has a very minimal false step count and does well counting even when the band is on an arm that you aren't moving (although on the treadmill you will need to move your arm a bit because you are stationary).  In terms of converting steps to distance, for myself it was spot on.  I did a few tests both on the treadmill and off and it is less than 1% off.  However, this can be greatly affected by one's stride - mine is apparently very, very average for my height.  This can be set though (for both walking and running) so there is no reason it can't be made accurate with a bit of testing.The fitbit can also act as an alarm (it vibrates), which has to be set from either the phone app or website.  The fitbit also can notify you of your progress by vibrating and through flashing lights when you hit your step goals for the day.The battery life is fantastic.  Even though it has an always on bluetooth connection and is constantly working throughout the day it lasts for at least 5 days (often 7) on a single charge.  It is very impressive and makes the product infinitely more usable since you don't have to take it off but once a week.The software is the best part though.  Through both the website and app you can get graphs that show your steps, calories, distance, and sleep quality.  Essentially the graphs are what sets this product apart.  You can track it through time and when you start checking it multiple times per day it really motivates you to take that extra walk around the floor or the stairs instead of the elevator.  You can also \"compete\" against your friends and family and see how your steps compare to theirs.  The app also has features to allow you to input your diet information as well as give specifics about your activities (i.e., running vs. walking vs. biking) so it can give a more accurate calorie count.In summary, this is a great little motivational tool.  It is a bit pricey at $99, but for me it was well worth the money.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V9IAYTBVB1GO?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_title": "Great Motivational Tool"}], [{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2016-01-25", "review_body": "This is my second flex.

I charged the device overnight and tried again the next day to no avail. I tried everything listed on all the help and FAQ sections of the fitbit website and still could not get the device to sync with the fitbit app I downloaded to my iPhone, iPad and laptop computer. I searched high and low for a phone number to contact for help because I was still excited about the product and wanted to get started right away. Nope, no phone number, only email, which I was immediately notified it could take 2 days OR LONGER to respond to my email due to high volumes. I sent an email to \"customer service\" (if you could call them that) and 2 days later, when I finally heard back from customer service I was instructed to try all the SAME EXACT THINGS I had been trying over and over again from the help sites (and quite frankly, treated as incompetent by the guy who was supposed to be helping me). After another day of back and forth emailing (with no new suggestions) it was determined that I had a defective product and was told I would be sent a replacement. When my replacement came yesterday, I went about all the same set up strategies and AGAIN, I could not get the product to sync to the iPhone app. I was however, successful in getting it to sync with my computer. I thought maybe the problem was with my iPhone as it is over 2 years old and getting a little sluggish lately. I tried to connect it with my company issued iPhone to test my phone theory and was able to sync the device with that phone. Great! I was up and running! Some of the lost excitement was beginning to return! Before bed last night I tried to sync again to see my overall results for the day and set it to track my sleeping and again, I could not sync. I am now coming to find that I can only sync the device to my home computer or to my phone only once it syncs to my computer first -- then it will send the latest update to my phone. This is a HUGE disappointment as I don't use my home compter as often and would like to be able to track and view my progress throughout the day.And, I checked my steps after I spent an hour at the gym last night and it greatly underestimated my workout. It tracked only 2 minutes of activity and only 1,100 steps... So basically, i just paid $100 for an ugly black bracelet with inaccurate pedometer capabilities. I hate it.

Immediately loaded the related software off of iTunes and downloaded the tools available.  Incredibly simple interface and tools -- I mean that in a positive way.  Approachable, simple and accessible.  I found it really great that once loaded on the iPad, it synced immediately and uploaded onto my iPhone 5s.  Having access to both means that I have no excuses not to stay current and track.For anyone who has ever tried to track their nutritional consumption, exercise, steps, weight, etc., it sometimes can seem like an arduous task that falls to the bottom of the priority list.  The led lights that come in when you tap the surface of the fitbit flex registers how much of your goal has been met based on the thresholds set by you within the tools.  The thresholds you set and goals are easily adaptive and you can see immediately how long it will take to accomplish your goals based on your input and choices.The charging and replacement of the fitbit component is easy.  The clasp on the band is easy to adapt to.  Only one clip comes with the two bands, so if you need the smaller band diameter, you must first remove it from the larger band.Within the tools, you have options to set and edit notifications, as well as track calories expended, activity, exercise and the system allows you to search with your contacts to link with friends.  There are four challenge options currently which give you one more avenue to address your fitness and activity goals.There is a scale available that I will be checking into which allows for wireless tracking of your weight.  I will check into that as well, as in my opinion, the more idiot proof I can make the process of getting healthy, the more I believe I'll stay engaged.  I will do some follow ups ...I typically like to do one month, three months, six months and one year on products, especially electronics or home gear.Not only will I let you know how the product performs, but I will also share how effective it has been for me personally.  Please stay tuned.  So far, I feel like I have a little bluebird on my shoulder reminding me that I need to adjust my lifestyle and activities.  It's pretty rewarding to go out and conduct your normal life activities and have the immediate gratification of seeing how far you have gotten.  I love it so far.  I hope this is a great accessory to complement good judgement and desire to change.

On the website login you can change activities, you can track all kinds of things.  Food intake can be tracked but the menu is very limited ... example: try to find a lot of Thai dishes, try to find grilled chicken breast nachos ... without it popping up a restaurant version which is ALWAYS high in sodium, fat, etc compared to homemade.The battery I find lasts 4 to 5 days and emails, messages your phone to say it is getting low.So, would I buy it again, absolutely!  It syncs great, it keeps up with steps on my phone, you can add friends who have the fitbit and message each other... you can add sleep log and a simple click when you go to bed you start, wake and stop.

First, the only documentation that comes with the product is a reference to a website, www.fitbit.com/setup. Of course you're required to create an account (or link to an existing Facebook account) before you're given any type of instruction. Attention marketing departments - We're tired of giving away our personal information as a condition to use the product we've paid for!After downloading and installing an application on my computer, another requirement to use this product, I followed the instructions and charged the battery using the included usb adapter. NOTE - do not lose this adapter because I've never seen anything like it and it would be difficult/expensive to replace.Finally, while the Fitbit does come with two straps, large and small, it only comes with one clasp. My concern is that this clasp is a small piece of soft plastic and breaking it would pose the same issue as replacing the charger. In addition, fastening the clasp requires the dexterity of a circus performer and the online help actually offers this advise ...\"If there is a bulge on the inside of the band between the two inside prongs of the clasp, find a small object like a credit card to push it flat.\" Try picturing yourself inserting a credit card between the band and your wrist while holding the strap and clasp in place, and pushing down on a small but bulging piece of rubber one handed! Securing the clasp seems much too difficult considering its function. Why not use an embedded magnet or some other less tedious design? Considering the price, Fitbit could have splurged just a little.I'll update this post in a couple of weeks based on overall usability, but for now I'm skeptical. After waiting about 6 weeks for delivery (why do companies refuse to step up production of high demand products?)

I even offered to pay the price difference.  They told me that they did not offer an upgrade program.  Instead, they did offer a discount for a new Flex 2.  OK I'm a sucker,  and I opted to upgrade to the Flex 2 (another $90 if you include taxes and shipping).

Don't like the nagging when I need more but that's a setting in my profile I can change.Battery life - specs say 5 days - my experience is better.  Charger is USB type - not sure how fast if connected to a PC, but charges quickly with my wall outlet USB charger.  IPad notification of low charge worked nicely.Adding food to selection list - I added some foods for calorie intake and also built a \"meal\" by doing the math of what I ate for breakfast and entering the totals as a new food.  So nice to add a food, but the app should also let you build meals.  My meal menus barely cover a full week, so would have liked to quickly build those meals on the App - doing it myself in an Excel file worked, but....  Anyway, I quit adding what I ate after a week so....  Not sure if this is crowd sourced data for selections.Weight tracking - manually enter your weight - decent tracking.Develop a weight loss plan - decent section of the app lets you find a targeted weight loss per week.What I don't like:Band too small - I can barely fit the large band on my wrist.  Be sure to measure yours before your order.  I am 6 foot and don't think my wrists that huge.  I am wearing it, but very tight - hot - sweaty and some skin irritation as result.Customer Support - Ok kind of like that they responded quickly to emails BUT You can get an extra large band if you contact support.  However, 15 days after that contact I still don't have a notification that the band has shipped.  Will be 5-7 days for shipping, so at best large band might get here in three weeks - at worst who knows.Band Size - even though an Extra large band is \"on the way\" - I will not be able to order an extra large band thru the online store.  I will need to contact support again.  If you make it you should sell it - what's with having only two sizes for sell in your store?Sleep Tracking - I have been using an IPhone app called Sleep Cycle - its really nice but the phone needs to be charging and on the bed - main reason I purchased the Fitbit was to get on-the-wrist sleep tracking.  Turning Fitbit on/off for sleep is some combo of tapping your wrist - I have never been sure if I have it on or off.  The data display on the dashboard is not world class.  It does nicely show that on at least one \"night\" it was really day and I was pretty active =  Also hard to remember to tell the wrist that I have gotten up.  SO - I gave up on using the Fitbit to track sleep and back to the IPhone app.  I did not buy the Premium reporting, so the Sleep stuff might not look so 2nd class if I paid the extra bucks.Premium Reporting - an annual charge of $50 to get better reporting - this really makes me mad.  Kind of like the $25 dollar PC printer where the ink costs $50 and lasts only a few months.  I can understand you want a business model that keeps the cash rolling in - but $50 per year for software that you have already written.  Wow bad plan in my mind.  How about new models with more features every couple of years - for example next model could measure my heart beat.Calories In - I am over-weight and so clearly don't have much experience with applications were you report how much you eat.  Guessing it's hard to make this quick and easy.  After one week I gave up.  It was not quick or easy.Could not give it away - tried to give the band to my daughter (she's been very active this year in losing weight, walking, running, etc.) so that I could feel free to order a different tracker from someone else.  She used it for an afternoon, but was as not impressed by the software as I was and turned me down on my offer of a free Fitbit band for herself.Heart beat rate - does not track it, but will let you put in the rate so it can be tracked.UPDATE:Dashboard telling me that the battery low - charged it up but no change in the dashboard, and several days info not imported.  Tried to force a sync using the Windows application.  The USB dongle reported to not be connected.  Pulled and re-seated.  No change.  Pulled, removed Windows app and restarted the Fitbit.  This did the trick - sync was successful and 5 days of data not lost.  One bit of confusion on my part, I first thought the message indicated that the Fitbit, in its charger was not connected to PC.  Connection the Fitbit directly to PC in its charger does not appear to do anything (besides charge).", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26WU5CUYI5D6K?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 1, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Can't fall in love with it - guessing it will be sitting on a shelf not used within 2 months"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-08-24", "review_body": "This product sucks...

In the end I paid extra to an Amazon seller rather than wait for stock.I know that the Flex is a wrist based pedometer and sleep tracker but I expected more from the user experience.First the Pros:1.  Fits well and the band does not come off even during a vigorous activity.2.  Software works well and there are no problems syncing to my computer or iPhone.3.  No problems with materials or workmanship.  The product looks good and feels fine.4.  Calorie count seems accurate and is only about 20 off from my BodyMedia in day-to-day wear.Next the Cons:1.  Sometimes the Flex indicates that it is in sleep tracking mode and does not track sleep data.2.  Sometimes I have to wait 2 or 3 syncs before my sleep data shows up in the app or dashboard.3.  Data is not accurate when engaged in moderate to vigorous activity.  I climbed a local mountain trail called the Grouse Grind.  It took me 2H 52M (a slow time) and the Flex only noted 6 minutes of vigorous activity.  I was panting!  The trail is 2.9km long and has a slope of 50.4.  I cannot link my Flex data to the Withings app which acts as my central health data point.While the Flex is easy to wear and syncs well, I do not feel that it is an improvement over the Fitbit One or my old BodyMedia.  Maybe I am asking too much from a pedometer!I will probably return my Flex (will decide after today's workout as I am also wearing my BodyMedia for comparison).Update:I just finished a short workout on the elliptical and compared my data from the BodyMedia and the Flex.  Both showed an increase in steps and calories.  The Flex showed fewer steps from the workout than the BodyMedia.  This is odd as the Flex was showing more steps from daily living than the BodyMedia so I thought it was more sensitive.  Also, the BodyMedia now shows more calories burned than the Flex.  Before the workout the were only apart by about 20.Overall, I will be returning the Flex this weekend.

Some observations:I wore this to Cedar Point and rode a ton of roller coasters.  I expected this to register 230,000 steps but the device was probably able to parse out all that motion and just count the steps.  That said, that WAS by biggest walking day.  But then again at Cedar Point you do a TON of walking.  Bottom line: wear it.I found the most annoying feature is the \"tap repeatedly to put into sleep mode.\"  My experience is that I can't tap it myself to put it into sleep mode but if I hammer anything or push a rickety grocery cart, then it has no problem putting itself into sleep mode!  I think Fitbit knows this because they added a feature to their app which solves this - in the mobile app for iPhone, you can tell it to start and stop your sleep cycle.  No more messing with the vibrate to start sleep mode.Speaking of the mobile app, one of the nice things about using these apps is that new changes can be pushed to me.  Water consumption goal was recently made editable, which is important for those of us trying to lose weight.My sync function works great.  Again, primarily use the mobile app vs. the wireless connection with my PC.Battery life is still 5 days.  A little annoying to have to stop tracking to charge it.  I like data.Strangely I haven't really used the data tools to analyze my history.

For example, I ride my bike 6 miles a day on occasion, and it did not measure the exact 'steps' taken during those times pedaling. I would consider some of the hills to be intense activity level (red), but the monitor only showed up to yellow, and not for the hardest hill....Also, when hitting bumps or going fast on the bike, the band will vibrate a lot to notify me it has changed into the sleep setting. I then have to tap it to get it back to recording my steps...Not compatible with LifeSpan treadmill desk:It does not record steps taken on my treadmill desk if I am typing (like right now) because my arm wearing the band is not at my side recording the stride vibrations. The only way to use this with a treadmill desk where your arms are typing is to loop the band onto your pants to measure your stride motion, thus your steps, since your arms are stationary. For this reason, I am returning it because the whole purpose was to measure my improvement in health and well-being through using the treadmill desk, which it won't do...Sleep measurement is too vague:I used to own the Zeo brand sleep headband for measuring REM sleep, deep sleep, etc.. The Zeo is 10 times more accurate in measuring your true sleep, as it can tell you every 'level' at which you are sleeping, minute by minute. When I slept a recorded 9 hours through Zeo is said I had 4-5 hours of deep sleep and 4-5 hours of more shallow REM sleep. It was really accurate. I could literally remember having a long dream and it would show I was in a dream mode during that exact time....However, this band reports that I only get 1.5-3.5 hours of sleep total each night (where it senses I am 'not moving'), and that the rest of the time is considered 'restless' sleep where my banded arm is moving. The difference in what Zeo records and what Fitbit records is huge. But I didn't buy this to measure my sleep, so it's fine.Silent alarm is dangerous:I used the silent alarm function once, and it wasn't as reliable as my iPhone. Once I tapped it and it disengaged, I was able to keep sleeping endlessly without a 2nd or 3rd alarm as a back-up. With the iPhone, you can simply turn the volume down so that it only vibrates in your bed, and set an unlimited amount of alarms to ensure you will have to get up, so the 1st one can be a vibration, and the 2nd one can be a sound, etc.Force Sync is where?When measuring my steps taken on the treadmill, I wanted to force it to upload my data in 15 min. increments, and it could not for the life of me find the so-called 'zip' or sync area of the website or on my dashboard. I literally just can't find it...If it's there, it certainly isn't CLEAR.Hygiene is poor:As other reviewers mentioned, the band stores water near the electronic piece if you shower with it, water your garden with it, or sweat with it...when you remove the digital piece, you will notice a mildew smell, even after only 1-2 weeks of new use.Novelty 'wears off', pun intended:I imagine this is what it was like with those digital pets you fed to keep alive. The fun novelty of tapping the band face to see my progress throughout the day, as displayed through flashing lights, is wearing off after 2 weeks of use. I am returning it mainly because it doesn't work as a wrist band device with my treadmill desk if I am typing, as mentioned above.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VCEA5KS1IJ14?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Only measures direct impact foot movement with arms by side, not biking, swimming, or steps on treadmill desk while typing"}], [{"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-09-20", "review_body": "I love the color, and it makes it easy to know how many steps you've done.

I do a lot of walking at work (school administrator) so when i bought it, all i wanted was a glorified, wearable pedometer to track my daily steps and calories burned.It does both of those things which is a pro. However, the cons outweighed it. First, I had a hard time putting the band on. Latching it was awkward because it's a rubber peg that you're pushing into a rubber hole. My wrists are pretty average, maybe a little thinner than most (I am a size 4), but it actually hurt putting the band on because I had to push it together so hard for it to latch.Twice the band fell off without me feeling it. I think the peg may have worked its way out of the rubber hole because both times it fell off happened in the afternoon after a whole day of wear.The actual tracker itself is a super tiny thing that looks like a flash drive. You have to bend the rubber band and push up in the center yo remove it. I was able to get it out without much effort but putting it in was harder and often took several tries.In order to charge it there's a special adapter you click the flash drive into. If you don't have the adapter you can't charge the device. So if you were to go on a trip and forget it at home you're up a creek.The website says it will stay charged for 5 days. By the first week I started getting low battery alerts at 2 - 3 days. By the second week and a half I began having to charge it daily.The sleep mode works best if u tap and put it into sleep mode manually. I found when I just fell asleep it didn't auto detect l was asleep, though the website said it would.I wish it had come with a manual. Like an actual, hard copy guide.

I originally purchased an UP24 due to some bad reviews for the Flex.  At the outset, let me say that the UP24 performed very well, and the software for it I installed on my iPhone is intuitive and easy to use.  I was not unhappy with it, at all, but I decided to purchase the Flex when my UP24 stopped working.  (I do hot yoga twice a week and I think my sweat got into the button on the UP24 and the salt made it inoperable.)The way in which the Flex is built, it has no weak spots like the UP24, so I decided to give it a try.  In the meantime, the UP folks offered to replace my UP24.  So for the past week or so I have worn both the UP and Flex on the same arm and can give you a \"side by side\" comparison.They are comparable, and there are certainly enough reviews elsewhere on the net that provides a more in-depth comparison than I'm qualified to make.  However, for an average user, here is my observation.  They both provide much the same information.  They are both compatible with LoseIt! (a must for me as I am working on maintaining a significant weight loss).  And they operate on the same principle.The differences are subtle in most cases.  The Flex tends to count more steps than the UP24.  I don't know which is more accurate because I haven't actually counted my steps.  However, the Flex is always more.  I recently changed the setting on the Flex that indicated I was wearing it on my non-dominate arm to showing it was on my dominant arm (but I kept wearing it on my non-dominant arm).  This made the Flex less sensitive to movement and the result has been my daily step total has been much closer to the UP24.The Flex's information on sleep patterns is not as robust as the UP24.  The Flex is less sensitive to sleep stages and routinely reports less \"light\" or \"restless\" sleep than the UP24.  Again, I don't know which is actually right, but the lack of detail doesn't help.This may be picky, but the Flex is more difficult to put on.  The band has a clasp that requires you to line up two \"pins\" that fit into corresponding holes.  The holes are tight and so it is not a simple process to line them up and get them in, especially considering it is a one handed job.  It gets easier over time as you figure out how to do it better.  And the holes/band become more flexible as well, making the process easier.  The up is a \"twist on\" deal.  You literally just wrap it around your wrist.But perhaps the biggest difference is the battery life.  The Flex is able to maintain a charge for about 5 days, depending on how my things you are asking it to do.  Alarms tend to drain the battery.  On the other hand, after a recent \"firmware\" upgrade on the UP24, it lasts approximately 14 days.  Again, alarms will cause it to deplete faster, but clearly the UP band has the edge in this category.On the positive, the Flex synchs with my iPhone and computer with much greater ease than the UP24.  I find that my UP is sometimes and hour or two old since the last synch.  This is never a problem with my Flex.  It updates quickly and regularly.  Plus there is a forced synch option on the Flex that is not available on the UP24.And the Flex also has the edge on feedback.  I can tap my Flex twice and see my progress toward my goal in lights on my wrist.  In order to know where I am with my UP24 I have to pull out my iPhone and open the app, and wait for it to synch.  Score a big one for the Flex.So which is better?  I have to give the edge to the Flex.  I like the UP24 primarily because of the battery life and the sleep detail.  But now that I've got the difference in counting steps issue solved, in truth I really like the Flex.  I like the cheaper price.  I like the ease of synch.  And I especially like that I can see my progress toward my step goal without having to access my iPhone.  And after all, that is why you buy an activity monitor.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E3ZXAH0MSQT6?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Flex versus the UP24 - Flex wins by a nose!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2013-11-13", "review_body": "It has been fantastic in reminding me every day to get some more activity into my life.

Also i did a 5 mile walk  this week and the steps never showed up...this is disapointing, because to pay 99 dollars for something you would think it would last longer than 4 weeks! the directions say that you can shower in it, but i chose not to, so it's not because it got wet.

I'm about 4 months in and already looking forward to getting a different version.  I had the pod before that clipped on my trousers, I thought the wristband would be better.Problems are- 1) the battery before was replaceable about every year, this one he to be charged each week and sometimes more. This is a complete hassle. Then I forget to put it back on again. Then I lose the points for that day with my company fitness program.  2) the band is way too bulky. It doesn't fit under my shirt sleeve for work, catches on my jacket, etc.  3) there is no information on the display. In fact there is no display really. It's rubbish, I have to synchronize Fitbit with the phone on their app, and then ensure my work Virgin Pulse account also synchs. Hassle.

I would keep them in my pocket and somehow they would come out when I went for my keys or to get change.  When I saw the Flex first mentioned, I knew that this would keep me from losing another one and ordered it the day it first became available for pre-order.PROS:- Wearing the device on the wrist means rarely forgetting to have it on you.  The only time you won't have the device with you is when you are charging it.  You can even wear it in the shower.- The battery life is outstanding.  I can go about a week between charging.- Fitbit has outstanding customer support.  The large wristband is a bit tight on my wrist (I need one more notch) and I guess for a lot of other people.  They are creating an XL wristband and are going to send me a free one.CONS:- Does not count floors climbed.  This is a feature the older Fitbits had.  I am not sure why this feature was not included since the cheaper models have it.- No immediate feedback.  With the old Fitbits, you could get exact counts since they had a display.  All you get with the Flex is five lights which light up to get you the percentage of your daily goal met.  I wish there was a display on this device.  There could have been an opening in the wristband where a display on the device would be visible.  I only get feedback when I sync with my computer.- Limited Android support.  Since the Flex does not give you exact feedback, the only way you get get actual numbers is either from a computer or from a device that supports Bluetooth 4 BLE.  Currently, Android does not have BLE support.  Some manufacturers added BLE to their devices, but with different APIs.  Currently, some Samsung phones are supported.  Unfortunately, I have the HTC One which isn't supported by Fitbit.  The next version of Android will have BLE support, so hopefully this issue will go away.- Accuracy doesn't seem to be as good as the older and cheaper Fitbits.  I don't know if it is because you wear the device on your wrist, but I seem to have larger daily totals than with the older models.  I always trusted the older models because I could test them.  I would count 200 steps and check out the number on the device and they would match (plus or minus a step).  I can't do the same with this device since there is no immediate feedback.- The wristbands are not durable.  It appears that the wristbands are made from two pieces and are probably glued together by the five lights.  My wristband is coming apart.  I am not sure if this is from it being slightly too tight or from me moving around in my sleep.Overall, I like the device.  It has some shortcomings that I am sure Fitbit will address in the future.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1B8UINJK03G5W?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 3, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "A good device you won't lose and Fitbit has outstanding support"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-08-18", "review_body": "I got this for my mom so that she can track all the walking that she does at work (hospital).

It looks stylish and seemed to be a good motivator to walk around more. But as soon as I opened it, I found this device to be a problem. First, I thought it was ridiculous that the instructions is a pamphlet that basically directs you to their website. I had a hard time placing the thing on, as the clamps are not user friendly and had to peruse the website (which surprise, surprise advertises their Fitbit Premium service for only $49.99/year). Finally when I figured out how to charge the device and put it on my wrist, I took it for a test jog. My fit bit was literally off by one mile! It made me feel good that I jogged 5 miles when in truth I only did 4 miles but it was very inaccurate. I went again to the web site and had to pursue the community pages on how to make it less sensitive: I placed the device from my non-dominant hand to my dominant hand, I changed my stride length, I changed it back to dominant hand. It still was way off. So, I figured, maybe this is just not good for jogging, but only for walking? Wrong again, it over calculated my steps! The sleep monitor is simply a joke--how would it know if I slept restfully or not? Because I sleep like a corpse vs. moving around? I honestly don't get the hype on this device, maybe the social aspect; maybe the cool chic factor; maybe we are all just consumer zombies when it comes to the newest shiniest electronic device.

I noticed when placing my order that there were several reviews that complained about the clasp. However, I have not experienced any of those clasp issues. I have worn the Fitbit with sweatshirts, sweaters, jackets, long sleeve polo, and long sleeve dress shirts and I have never had a problem with the clasp becoming disengaged. I will share that the first few days, until the rubber portion of the wrist band becomes accustomed to the clasp, it may be a bit difficult to engage the clasp once you determine the right size.  In my opinion that is to be expected with any new product.The battery stays charged generally for 5 days +/- and there was one day when I intentionally did not charge it to see how far into the next day it would still work. From my experience and to insure that you do not lose battery power I would recommend that the unit be charged once it hits 25% battery level.The step calculator appears to be accurate from what I have observed.I particularly like the silent timer function that allows me to set a vibrating alarm for various times each day. I experimented with different times during the day to determine the consistency and reliability of the alarm function and verified that it never missed an alarm.I have the FitBit synched to both my laptop and my iPhone.If you use the alarm function I have discovered that it is much easier to activate the sleep function through the iPhone than by double tapping the Fitbit. Likewise, it is easier to develop the habit of ending the sleep function through the iPhone in the morning.There are many other features that I like with the Fitbit and too many to review here.If you are looking for a quality pedometer that allows you to track your sleep patterns, fluid consumption, weight target, calorie intake/burns, and be able to set silent vibrating alarms then I believe you will be happy with a Fitbit.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OZOX7YVGA97B?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 5, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "Good product"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2013-07-16", "review_body": "I love the fitbit that hooks on your pants it shows your distance and all your other information on the front.

I have restarted my Fitbit four times today to get it to sync!I decided to do some research on the Fitbit website on the \"Forum\" section.  There are numerous people who have the same exact issues with their Fitbit!  I could not believe how many people had posted about this problem.  I posted a question in the forum about the problems that I have been having, in the hopes that I would get a reply from the company with some suggestions.  So far I have had no such luck.  I am most likely going to send this unit back as well and get another brand of fitness tracker...  Like I said, I really wanted to like this product but I have been very disappointed with not one, but two of these products.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CVV4OA6JEIZ4?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_title": "Extremely Problematic"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-10-09", "review_body": "I have had a few of these.

It's so easy to tell myself, 'yeah, I worked out a couple days ago' when in reality it was 4 days ago or more!  It's a really fun way to just be more aware, stay out of denial, avoid delusions, and get on track.  It's not perfect, but he site is very well designed and fun to use.  The food log is particularly well thought out, although again I'm not sure how accurate all the calorie counting is, but then most of the new research is saying calorie counting is the wrong approach.  What we eat, how it metabolizes in our bodies, and reducing processed carbohydrates is key. I think if you have common sense, don't get obsessed, and use it for fun and awareness about what you are really doing, it's a great product.

I also purchased the Fitbit Aria, figuring they would make a good pair.First, the good stuff:- It's comfortable and looks pretty good.  Fit is highly adjustable, and it comes with a large and small band, so no matter what your wrist size, you should be able to get a good fit (expect possibly for the largest wrists).- It functions about as expected.  The steps counted seems to run a bit high compared to the UP, but the difference is small.  - The silent wake alarm is a great feature, and I actually like the Flex's alarm better than the UP since you tell it exactly when to go off, whereas the UP will try to guess when it thinks you should wake up (within a programmable window before your set alarm time).- The website \"dashboard\" syncs immediately and is pretty user friendly, as is the smartphone/tablet app.- If you pair this with the Aria scale, the dashboard becomes extremely useful - giving you a very comprehensive perspective on your fitness.Now for the not-so-good stuff:- The sleep tracking is minimal.  The UP will tell you when you were in deep sleep, when you were in light sleep, and when you woke up.  The Flex supposedly can do the same thing, but for three nights running, it shows I slept like a log with NO periods of light sleep at all.  That is physically not possible.  It simply does not show your sleep cycles as well as the UP at all.- Battery life is just over half as long as the UP.- To sync with your computer, you have to use an included USB dongle.  With wifi and bluetooth connectivity these days, that's just ridiculous.Now, for the downright UNACCEPTABLE:- Customer service for Fitbit simply does not exist.  What I'm about to write has to do with my Aria scale, but it's about the company Fitbit as a whole and what kind of support you can expect (to NOT get).  When I bought my scale, it would not connect to my wifi as it is supposed to.  I sent an email to customer support.  I got an automated response, and their website showed my case as pending.  3 DAYS LATER THEY HAD NOT BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ME AT ALL.  I emailed them again, and again.  I got absolutely no response.  I still haven't.  I eventually figured out with some we searching on my own that their computer based setup program doesn't work (you have to use a phone or tablet).Basically, they have a broken piece of software that you supposedly have to use in order to start using what you bought.  They haven't fixed it, and refuse to give you any help or even answer your emails.It seems as if they just don't care about the customer at all.  So I say take your money elsewhere.  No product is worth supporting a company that won't take care of you as the customer.I give the band itself 4 stars.  I give the web based tracking 4 stars.And I take back almost all of those stars for non-existent customer service/support.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJZLFJ4TECLIA?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-10-23", "review_body": "I love my fitbit!

These are important to me, since I make my living with a computer and am therefore more sedentary than most.  This is the first fitness item I've tried, so have no comparison with others.  I also got the scale they make to go with it, and that makes it even easier -- The scale is also on wi-fi, so it automatically loads your weight into your dashboard every time you weigh.  Clever.I had mine for a day or two before my husband got intrigued and ordered one for himself.  He really likes his, too.If I had one wish for improvement, I'd say the food database could use some grooming.  Many of the items show wildly different nutritional facts, and sometimes all you get in a search is restaurant items.  All in all, though, it's useful.  I've lost 10 pounds in about three weeks.Info for reviewer who thinks the wrist band is getting funky:  While you have the module out for charging, just swab the inside of the band where it usually goes with rubbing alcohol.  Then swab the module with it before you put it back in the band.  Takes care of the issue with no need to replace the band.Update after 6 months of ownership:Wristband just came apart, but luckily I'd ordered a different color a few months ago.  It ripped next to where the capsule goes in.  Guess it's kind of expected, since it's worn all the time and in the shower, etc.  Too much trouble to send it back for the warranty, since it's a $14.95 item.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWW43XNU6M8IM?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Happy with it."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-03-24", "review_body": "I bought this almost a year ago and had to replace the band 4 times and now it does not work at all.

The great part is that I believe that my lifestyle is sustainable, unlike other diets and programs I have used before. Portion-control is key; I eat pretty much what I want, but I have certainly increased the servings of fruits and vegetables and reduced my meat and wine servings per day.

The main features that stood out to me where the water resistance, solid band fastener(many other trackers reviews complained of bands not holding well), and battery life. This unit generally lasts about 5 days per charge,  which is nice. I tend to charge it while i'm idle at the computer, so I don't miss out tracking anything. The extended features are great as well. The sleep  tracker and silent alarms are really great. At first I was skeptical about being awoken by a vibrating wrist band, but I can attest, the moment that alarm goes off, I am awake, and it is a far less annoying way to wake up, compared to a blaring alarm clock. I could see this being really helpful if you need to wake up without disturbing a sleeping partner. The only reason I did not mark this device 5 stars, is that it can be a bit finicky to charge, and the wrist band it fits into does not last as long as I would like. After about 8 months of continuous wearing, the band developed a crack near the display. I fixed it with super glue, but it turned out to be the first of many. After the second crack appeared in a new place near the display, I ordered a new band, which was backordered almost 4 weeks. By the time I got the band, I had repaired mine probably 10 times. Now, I admit, 8 months of continuous wear is not bad (I do take it off to shower, simply because while it is water resistant, I'd rather not risk it). But it would be nice to get a full year out of a band.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMFK17622F4Y3?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Great features in a small package."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2014-06-30", "review_body": "You need to check your app to see what calories you've burned, steps taken, etc. I didn't like wearing it as an accessory, either.

I don't like wearing watches or bracelets, but this doesn't bother me at all.I like the app/website to log calories and water intake.The lights keep me motivated without having to know exactly how many steps I've taken.The battery does last several days.The sleep portion is interesting because I didn't know I woke up/moved so much in the night (okay, I did, but not what times), and the weekly log they send via email shows how well I slept for the week.I like the weekly email telling me how I did the previous week on steps, calories, sleep, etc.My husband is a large 6'5\" man and he loves it and is motivated by it too. He sweats a lot and the band stays put and lives through the sweat bath. And the large band fits him (on the last tick lines). We compete with steps and it's fun!Negatives/ other comments:Sleep mode isn't perfected. My band will sometimes go into sleep mode during the day after some movements (clapping, holding a nail for hammering, using the blower or mower, etc.), which is irritating because I don't realize it and I miss out on steps. I wear it on my non-dominant hand too. Also, in the night, sometimes I sleep on my arms and with the bracelet on my wrist, it pushes into the backside of my wrist and causes my hand to go numb, so I haven't been sleeping with it as much.I wish it had a clock on it since I'm already having to wear it on my wrist.I don't wear it in the shower even though it says it will be fine.

I have not compared it to other similar items such as UP or UP24.  I did read on other web pages where the accuracy of Flex vs UP and so on were compared and it seemed to be similar in results.Positives:  I like having the light indication.  There are 5 lights to mark your progress through the day (I have mine set to monitor calories burned vice steps taken thru the day).  Once you reach your goal it vibrates and the lights go back and forth to let you know.  The wrist band is non-interference and I really don't know its there.  It is easy to set up your goals on the computer/phone/tablet with the FITBIT program.  The food tracker you can use on the program is also very easy to use.  The battery lasts me about 4 1/2 days but my wife's  battery lasts her 6 (typically);  when you log into the FITBIT program it gives you an idea of how much charge is left on your Flex.Cons:  The wrist item which holds the plug that measures your activities tends to retain water; not a huge concern but if I forget to wipe it out after my shower then it will stay moist and irritate my skin. Switching from normal to sleep mode is some what random; it seems that doing simple items in the yard (shoveling, gardening etc..) will switch it to sleep mode (now it will vibrate and if I'm not active when it switches I can feel the vibration otherwise it could be in sleep mode for several hours before I notice).Overall:  I'm very satisfied with the Flex and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something to help them keep track of their activities.  I don't necessarily count calories but I do find while putting in my food and workouts I pay more attention at eating times to the quantity I eat (which is a positive thing).", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AQ6CJPGJX9H7?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Satisfied!"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2015-03-07", "review_body": "I love it.

The only time I have noticed an inaccuracy is when I am using tools or other machinery that might cause the motion sensors to be triggered when I am really not moving.  For example while driving on a dirt washboard road, the flex picked up all the vibration in the wheel and thought I had just run 5,000 steps.  Things like that can be of a hassle, but for the most part, the flex is accurate.  The ability to track sleep is also a great feature.  Simple to turn on, simply tap the band five times quickly and it sets the mode to sleep.  Again, the band is really unnoticeable and comfortable to wear, so sleeping with it on is no big deal.The one word of caution I would mention is that the latch that holds the band on the wrist can come loose and allow the band to fall off if hit just right.  I play basketball and on several occasions have had the band fall off after being hit on the wrist.

I paid $40 for it, so I'm getting my money's worth. I wouldn't dream of paying more.It tracks steps. It says that it tracks \"moderate activity time\" but apparently nothing I've done has counted as strenuous enough (which can't be true). I haven't managed anything that would register, despite being fairly active and taking several long vigorous walks. During my desk-job week, it is a nice motivator to walk more. My biggest complaint (and maybe I should have known this) is that it doesn't consistently show step progress. The lights go off unless you tap to wake it up. Then it shows your progress lights for a couple of seconds. I found myself constantly referring back to the app for actual information on progress.The sleep tracker supposedly shows time asleep. It adds marks for restless periods and wakeful periods. If I understand the directions, it should sense when you are asleep and awake and start that monitoring automatically. You have the option of putting it to sleep and waking it up manually by tapping. The one time that I forgot to manually put it to sleep it charted a huge mess of restful and awake for about 13 hours, so I don't really buy the claim that it can sense these periods. It also showed that I took a solid two hour nap when I went to see Rogue One, which is definitely not true since I got up to get refills twice.I felt that the flex needed a lot of babysitting. I had to tap it to see my progress. I had to tap it to put it to sleep and wake it up. The battery worked for a week without charging, so that was nice. For what I paid, I like it as a reminder to be more fit. If I have a crappy night's sleep, I usually know so it didn't tell me much there. Other than that it's a fancy pedometer.

I debated over ordering the flex or opting to order a more expensive Fitbit, and I am very happy I went with the flex. It's the perfect size, I don't feel like something is big or clunky on my wrist, long sleeved shirts cover the Fitbit with ease and comfort. The initial goal is 10,000 Steps/5miles and I'm looking to reach that goal everyday. If I haven't reached my quota by the end of the day I take a walk around the neighborhood until I do. It keeps me on track to exercise EVERYDAY instead of here and there. I also love that is counts my calories that go in and OUT. Using myfitnesspal I was always focused on what I consumed and only logged exercise done at the gym. With Fitbit I'm able to acknowledge the calories I burn while sleeping or walking around during the day. It helps me maintain a calorie diet that is perfect for me. I received my Fitbit on Monday (it's now Thursday) and after an initial charge, I haven't taken it off since.

If you expect a lot more than that, you might be disappointed.Some negatives: I do NOT like the clasp - would love to see this band with a watchband type clasp, I struggle Every Single Time to put it on. I seem to have to charge more often than I thought I would, but receive a message when the Flex needs charging, which is helpful.The step counting is not 100% accurate, but close enough that I know I am in the ballpark of reaching my goal every day. The Flex does not count flights of stairs, wish it did.Some positives: since I am a goal-oriented, check-box ticking type of person, I love meeting my goals for the day (and these are totally adjustable, you can start a little low if you are feeling like 10,000 steps a day is too much). I gave myself a February 10,000 steps minimum every day challenge, and really like feeling that slight buzz the wristband gives me when I reach that goal. I find it very comfortable to wear all the time, and rarely take it off (charging and baths, otherwise, stays on). The iPhone app (free) is very, very nice, kudos to the development team. Sleep feature is not 100% accurate either, but fun to look at for a few days. I was surprised to find out I'm really not getting 8 hours most nights, and didn't know how much less sleep I was getting until I tracked it on the Flex. I also like the badges that the Flex grants you for reaching goals, and was weirdly pleased when I received my first 20,000 steps in one day badge - it's just pixels, but still loved getting it.Future versions: please, Fitbit, include a stair counter, a buzz timer that can be set to go off when I've been sitting for a specified time period (to remind me to get up and move around) and a BETTER CLASP!

Through the app you can manage goals, keep track of calories consumed and glasses of water drank. The app allows you to connect with friends that have a Fitbit where you can make daily challenges or weekly step challenges with your friends. This is a feature that I enjoy because it keeps me accountable for my work outs and activity level. My friends and I will have weekly agreements where the loser of the week has to buy ice cream for the group.Water ProofWhen I was comparing the Flex to other Fitbit products, the Charge and Surge, I found the waterproof quality of the Flex to be most appealing. The Charge and Surge products recommend being kept away from water, but as a work out device, it was crucial that I had something that I could take with me in and out of the water.Where is the Clock?If I could change the Flex, I would like it to have a clock on the screen. The screen consists of 5 dots that light up and blink when you meet your goals and they show you how far you are from your goals for that day. A clock on the screen would be useful, instead of having to wear the Flex and a watch.The Flex has an alarm clock in it. Through the app, you are able to set alarms and when it is time for the alarm to go off, the Flex will vibrate until you tap it to shut it off. I would like to have there be a snooze option on this feature. I do not use this feature of the Flex due to it not having a snooze and the vibrations are not defined enough to wake me up.4 Star ProductOverall, I give the Flex 4 stars. It is simple to use through the app, allows you to manage goals, and still is able enough to meet a budget.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QYMOII7J3R6B?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 4, "review_title": "Overall, 4 Star Product"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2016-09-10", "review_body": "It gets dirty so fast, and stays dirty.

I first bought The Flex which is a wrist band. I had it only for a week and my wife had to have one too. We are both in our 40's and we are making efforts to lose weight and be healthier. We'd heard about these at loseit.com. The devices were highly recommended by many in the loseit.com community and for good reason. The Fitbit does a great job of giving the wearer a more clear and accurate portrait of activity metrics (calories burned in particular) than simply guessing based on age, weight, and sex. I've used mine for about 6 months or so and it's worked great. I love it. My wife used it for about 4 months without a problem but then developed a small rash on her wrist where she wore her Fitbit. She let the rash heal completely, and tried wearing it again and the irritation reappeared almost immediately. She did try to wash the band before trying it again. This was really not all the drama. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that the folks at Fitbit are not purposely or inadvertently infusing nefarious bacteria into their wrist bands. We (humans) are living, breathing, oozing, sweating, leaking, bacteria laden creatures. IMHO, Fitbit has absolutely no culpability in this matter which is why we were so surprised by their response to my wife's request for advice. Fitbit offered to send a replacement unit. In her case, they are sending The One which is a clip version which she'll wear on a belt or clothing. These folks get it. Rather than shuck and jive, leaving customers to solve the issue on their own or simply lose the opportunity to use the device, the folks at Fitbit are actively guarding their reputations and relationships with their customers by going the extra mile in helping folks with this situation. I've read countless other accounts of them doing the same for others.

It is not clear how to insert the tracker into the band because the instructions have a drawing that differs from the actual device. The website is confusing to navigate and use, with lots of sections that do not work for this particular model. Apparently they have a generic website for multiple models with different functions. So what you see for this model is a screen cluttered with stuff you cannot use. For example, this model does not count floors or actually assess your sleep (although you can notify it when you are going to sleep and when you wake up). The instructions on the website are poor and the search  engine often results in an error  message or says that something is not available now and to check later. You mostly have to figure out for yourself how to enter food and activities. Activities like riding a stationary bike will be recorded by the tracker as periods of inactivity so there is no credit for them in the log. Be careful that the date of entry does not switch to the wrong date. Entering food is annoying because you have to choose from a long list of brand name foods, as though no one ever eats home-cooked foods. I generally pick a brand of food that looks like the calorie total is about the same as what I ate. It is also annoying to be flooded with advertisement and suggestions to upgrade this product.

The first day I had it on, I was at my desk for 8 hours.  I probably took 1,000 steps throughout my day but at the end of my work day, with all my hand movements, it said I had 4,000 steps.  This is a little more than a \"few extra steps.\"  The next day I was off and at home.  Working around my house, doing some chores and putting some furniture together, I also probably walked about 1,500 steps around my house.  The device calculated 12,000 steps by the end of the day.

I'm disappointed that the band broke, but I was able to purchase some knock-off brands so I have some that I can use.  I like the fact that it tracks my sleep, every step I take, and more.  The dashboard is also very helpful to view my progress in how far I've walked and how much water I've drank.  I used to have a WeightWatchers ActiveLink tracker that was fine, but I had to pay $5 a month for that thing to sync to my WW account.  It was also able to track my activity, but I had no idea how many steps or how far I would walk, since it would only capture the time I was active.  With the Fitbit, I don't have to pay anything and it also syncs to WW now.  From doing the same activities when I had the WW ActiveLink and doing them now with the Fitbit, I'm still earning the same amount of activity points, so I believe that the Fitbit is as accurate as the WW ActiveLink, which is something that I was worried about since it's worn on the wrist instead of on my bra. I'd give it 5 stars if the band hadn't broken less than a month of wearing it.

As of now, today, it's working beautifully.  Still, I'd suggest that anyone interested in the device sign up for a Fitbit account first (it's free) and poke around the forums a bit to see what kind of problems people are having and how long it's taking to resolve them.If you ride a motorcycle (or drive a car, truck, tractor, etc.) then this device is useless and wildly inaccurate.  IF it worked as intended, it would be great.  I had high hopes for it at first... for about half a day.  Then I noticed it had registered thousands of steps during my morning commute.There's a way to add an activity such as motorcycle riding that's supposed to override the steps counted in error.  Well, that doesn't work.  I contacted support in the middle of October and was told that it was a \"known issue\" and the developers were \"looking into it\".  It's now a month later and the issue is still not fixed.  My Flex is still counting thousands - sometimes tens of thousands - of extra steps each day, and there's no way to remove them.Considering that nearly everything this device tracks (distance traveled, calories burned, active minutes, calories in vs out, calories left based on your meal plan) is predicated on an accurate step count, I'd say this is a pretty major bug.  The only things it tracks accurately are calories consumed and water intake, and I could do that with a pencil and paper!It's too bad the developers didn't think to include a way to just temporarily turn the darn thing OFF.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BIZCIPGLJ6IZ?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 4, "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_title": "If you do NOTHING other than walk, ever, then this may work for you."}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2016-07-31", "review_body": "It's already broken.

Steps taken, calories burned, distance and active minutes are all way off. In sleep mode (which you have to activate in which no instructions tell you that) I burn 800 calories. Are you kidding me? Also, the step counter registers steps in your sleep thus adding onto calories burned and distance traveled. That's a joke. Their support forums say the fitbit is tested to be accurate while typing, talking on a phone, riding in a car, ect,. well guess what? I earn 700 steps by riding 5 miles in my car to work. Thus once again adding to the calories burned, steps taken and distance. I finally found a setting where you can turn \"estimated calories\" off and on, that seemed to have helped somewhat but it's still very inaccurate. No person on this planet burns 1796 calories by getting dressed, walking to your vehicle, driving to work, walking to your office, sitting down and working on a computer/phone all day. That's without my daily jogs alone in which i burn 139 calories on going just a few short miles for an hour. I've even set my walking and running strides to the approximate setting. I can count myself walking 50 steps, the fitbit registers 300 and says I've gone 0.3 of a mile. This is a horrible device and no way to calibrate it.

I gave this 3 stars because it does what it does well (count steps, count sleep), but some of its \"expected\" features are missing.Pros:-Counts steps well-Counts sleep well-Extremely well-thought-out app GUI with helpful facts/figures, suggestions, social interaction, etc.-Fits fairly well-Lightweight-Automatic e-mail when the battery is low (may about half the time)Cons:-Putting this thing on is a hassle and you actually have to dig those two metal barbs into your wrist so that they poke through the other side of the band.-Even going about my daily job, the material (maybe a neoprene or some type of elastomer like EPDM, NBR, etc.) seems to keep moisture under the band.  Tip: Don't ever smell that area when it's dried.  You are gross.-Charging is intermittent, at least with mine.  Often, the Fitbit itself fits into the USB charger but doesn't ever charge.  You see the the four exterior lights blink (middle one does not), indicating there is an issue.  Mine was (allegedly) the contacts were dirty, which I cleaned with a pushpin and carefully make sure not to scratch the female metal contacts on the Fitbit itself-After about 4 months of moderate use, I noticed the band starting to tear, where the Fitbit goes into and out of the band.-After 6 months of moderate use, the band has split in two places where the Fitbit goes into and out of the band.  I am very concerned that the Fitbit itself could fall out at any time and have ordered a replacement.-The app often has connectivity issues to my phone.  I have no issue to connect other devices seamlessly to Bluetooth, but this one often loses connection and doesn't go past \"Looking\" and into the \"Syncing\" phase.  The resolution I found is that restarting my phone, my bluetooth, and the app itself yields good results... but that's cumbersome, just to sync my Fitbit...-You will inevitably completely discharge your Fitbit's battery at some point.  First of all this is its own con, in that the battery life has decreased dramatically from Week 1 until Week 26 of me owning this Fitbit.  I could go an entire week without charging it at first, and now I need to charge it every ~60 hours... ouch!-Second of all, when the Fitbit becomes discharged and then I charge it again, I personally have experienced an issue where the Fitbit reports a completely inaccurate timeline of steps/sleep!  I guess the total amount of steps is accurate since the previous sync, but that's not the point.  The point is that this device is expected to accurately report steps/sleep in the timeline they occurred... not that I walked 45,000 steps in one day and only a few hundred each day for the other days.  This personally matters to me, because my workplace requires us to walk a certain number of steps per day in order to maintain \"lower\" health insurance rates (lol).  This has happened at least twice that I'm aware of.Overall, I'd say I feel ok with my purchase.  My overall expectation of the Fitbit was moderately met, but has some serious downfalls.  I really do want to like this product, but it's difficult at times to feel like something which has been on the market for at least 3.5 years before I bought it could perform this poorly and still receive such high praise.  I only expected the more expensive models to have more features, but if they have any of these same issues, then I won't continue to support Fitbit.  Bands should not be an item that is expected to be replaced regularly... do you replace your watch band every 6 months or your serpentine belt ever 6 months?  Probably not.  The app shouldn't be buggy if that's a key interface for the device to operate correctly.  Also, battery life shouldn't have such issues.  I just hope my battery life doesn't get cut in half again in the next 6 months.", "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BNF8ISA0SMTN?ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O", "review_rating": 2, "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_title": "Loads of mechanical, electrical, and software issues"}, {"article": "Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black", "price": 79.99, "review_date": "2016-02-22", "review_body": "My Fitbit flex was sent to my house within one week of me ordering it and I love it.
