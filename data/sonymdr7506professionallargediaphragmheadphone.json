I like generally flat sound. I'm more concerned with clear mids and highs and want present but not overpowering bass and low bass.Headphones I've tried include the following with my totally subjective sound rating on 10 point scale. YMMV.Audio Technica ATH-M50X - highs a little subdued for my liking - 7Beats Studio 2 Wireless - Subdued highs, some mid bass emphasis but not overpowering. 6Bose QC25 - A little weak on bass and weak on highs, best ANC. 7Bose QC35 - Can be a little bassy, especially at low volume. Bright highs. Best ANC. 9JBL - EVEREST 700 - Way too bassy. 5.JBL - Everest Elite 700 - Much better than non-Elite, 7OPPO PM-3 - Excellent, expensive. 10Sennheiser 202 - yuck. Too bassy, no highs, but cheap. 4Sennheiser 280 - well balanced. 8Sennheiser Momentum M2 - Close to perfection. 9.5Sennheiser PXC-550 - wireless noise cancelling. These are excellent. 9Sony - MDRXB950BT/B - Extra bass says it all. 4Sony 7506 - Perfection 10Out of all that I've tried the Sony 7506 are closest to perfection, to live performance. They are not bass heavy at all but can produce comfortable solid bass down to quite low frequencies. Tonal balance leans towards the upper mids and highs. Bright but not harsh. You end up hearing subtle sounds in the music that is missing with other headphones. Those who want more bass or don't want bright highs won't like these. But for my listening taste this matches perfectly.They are also very comfortable. Many of the headphones listed above are not as comfortable. Either tight band or thin band or ear cups that aren't big or deep enough. These headphones are great. Biggest disadvantage vs. many that I've tried recently is that these are wired... with a long heavy cord easy to get caught on things. I was looking for a wireless headphone. But ultimately I couldn't find one at a reasonable price that sounded anywhere near as good as these. Next closest was the Sennheiser PXC-550, but at $400, wireless wasn't worth an extra $320. I also found that there were times I didn't want noise cancellation. Too bad Sony doesn't make a wireless headphone with anywhere near this sound.Best of all, these are by far the cheapest of the decent sounding headphones I've listened to.  The headphones in this list range in prices from $20 to $450.Highly recommend the Sony 7506... if you like this sort of sound signature.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37YSFOBHJWHCP?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "High Quality Headphones", "review_helpful_votes": 165, "review_date": "2017-06-29", "review_body": "I'm rating these five stars, but they do have one pretty big negative. They are excellent, studio quality headphones. If you plan to wear them out and about though (like the NYC commuter I am) they effectively also serve as earmuffs. That's all well and good in winter, but on the June day I wore them out, I was sweating out the top of my head and down my neck. Amazing sound quality, but not great for being out in the heat. In their defense, these headphones never made that claim. They never made any claims at all, as they are an inanimate object without speech capability. They do have the capability to deliver superb sound quality though, which is mostly what you want in a pair of headphones.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38FIUBTXPYINM?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "SOUNDs like you should buy these headphones!", "review_helpful_votes": 209, "review_date": "2015-01-18", "review_body": "These are my favorite pair of headphones I have tried so far. The overall sound of these are very balanced. This means the Low, Medium, and high tones are for the most part balanced out. You can easily look up a lot of information on these headphones. They are an industry standard which I have enjoyed owning for more than two years now.The overall design of the headphones is fairly good. They are structurally well designed for the most part.- Noise isolation is mediocre. You can hear people saying things through these depending on the volume.- Sound leakage on the original pads is fairly low. People won't have to hear your music when it is at a fairly loud volume.- Extremely long, coiled cable with 1/4-inch adapter. Possibly gold connections.- Sturdy cable design. Each cable bend point is reinforced with additional rubber. Soldering to the driver seems sturdy as well, it should be able to withstand most tugs. This is usually not an issue with the gargantuan coiled cable. The coiled cable also prevents a large number of tangles!- The headband is fairly comfortable. You could easily find a cover for it if it becomes a problem.- Cup adjustment pieces have numbers on them to ensure a specific setting.The problems I've had with these over time:- Headband will lose its tension between your ears over time. These headphones no longer fit as soundly on my head as they used to.- Faux leather pads will need to be replaced. I have included a picture of both of my ripped pads which I replaced with \"Beyerdynamic EDT250V Headphone Ear Pads Black\" these will create some additional noise leakage.- The wire that connects the drivers to the headband can get stuck in the housing. (see picture) This may wear the wire a bit.- Cable is extremely long. This can be an issue when you want to use these headphones outside of their intended purpose. The cable is generally a bit heavy, causing strain to the connections. I very often have to move it around to have it stop bothering me. The cable can be replaced with some soldering. There have been projects modifying the headphones to have a detachable cable. Google \"Sony MDR-7506 Detachable Cable Mod\" that I believe would improve the design of the headphones.- Like all over the ear headphones, these will be uncomfortable with glasses. They do become very uncomfortable after a few hours.- While these do come with a transport bag, even the fold up design makes them a bit of a pain to transport. This is to be expected.- Fold up design doesn't center the cups when the length of each ear cup is at minimum. (See picture) Not sure what this does to the longevity of the headband.- The blue portion of the \"Professional\" stickers on the sides are decals. One of mine peeled off. It looks similar, but is starting to disappear, and collects dust. (see picture)Aside from a few gripes, these are still my favorite set of headphones. They simply sound right. I was appalled to go to the store and listen to some Bose headphones and hear how bad the quality was in comparison: for a set of $300 headphones.These are undoubtedly worth the price. Don't hesitate to buy them if you can overlook the problems i have had.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JJLW21Q7FQVE?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Worth every penny.

That being said....WOW. For the price, or even not for the price, these are the single best headphones not only that I've owned but that I've ever listened to. That includes the very high-end cans on sample at Brookstone, Best Buy, etc. Of course, I am not a seasoned audiophile but I know when something sounds good. These sound GREAT. There are pros and cons though:Pros:The sound. The glorious, clear, nuanced sound. Just amazing, and if you've always wondered how music is supposed to sound, these are your new headphones. There is a reason these are used in studios by professionals and have been for over 20 years (in which time, the design of the headphones has never changed!). There is no bias in the sound profile, just balance and clarity like nothing you've ever heard before.The sound.The sound.Noise-cancellation. These are not actually designed for it. but given that they are pretty impressive. I usually have them driven pretty hard and turned up to a decent volume. but that's how they're meant to be used and they do not disappoint or let in anything you don't want to bother you.Comfort. Very nice, don't grab my head too hard, I can wear them for an hour or more before giving my ears a short break.The cord. I play guitar, and I can stand and move around without any worry because the cord is very long and allows a lot of freedom.The price. I paid around $80 for these and they far outperform anything I've ever owned, which includes Beats by Dre and others.Cons:The cord. These are sit-at-home headphones. I mean, do as you please, but personally I wouldn't be walking around or using these as everyday headphones. At around 10' long and coiled, it isn't as convenient as some.The bass. If you're a bass junkie, I'm sorry but you will be disappointed. These are meant to deliver a perfect sound profile, the one intended by the original producer. Even then, on dubstep songs and such, the bass falls flat. Not a big deal to me, even though I love bassy songs, because these are so impressive in other regards that I can deal with the lack of power. They do, however, have extremely quick, punchy, satisfying response throughout the audio range and that includes bass....they just lack the power of headphones like Beats and such which are designed for bass.Overall, just get them. Worth every penny. I use them for studying, playing guitar, watching movies, listening to high-quality audio, etc. and they are always impressive to me. It is actually fun to listen to things with them because everything sounds so good! Everything you've heard on headphone forums and favorable reviews is true, they really are impressive.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NLQEAS67Y7CZ?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "A few words for your ears.", "review_helpful_votes": 33, "review_date": "2016-01-02", "review_body": "In 1991 Sony introduced the \"Closed\" MDR7506 headphones to audio professionals. Impeccable neutrality, outstanding comfort, and timeless build quality soon made them an industry standard. Today is January 2, 2016. And yes, 25 years later they remain by far the go to headphones of audio pros everywhere. They were high resolution before there was high resolution, Hi Res. The Sony MDR7506 is a true classic. They are great for all genres of music but they will not fake it. If the source ain't good, then the source will not sound good. But if the source is good, then the sound will be just as good. Lead vocals and lead guitars will take their place at center stage. Everything will be in its place the way the artists and engineers wanted it. And everything will be heard. Great music comes into full bloom. Hallelujah!If I only had two pairs of headphones for listening to music and watching movies at home one would be a Closed and the other an Open back headphone. Though I prefer the open to the closed \"sound \" in general there is a time and a place for both. And sometimes my ears just get stale and need a change. All open and no closed makes Butch have dull ears... For its vivid clarity, wide soundstage, and outstanding comfort my Open choice would be a pair of Sennheiser HD600 Open Back Professional headphones. Check! Nothing less than $400 is as good. For my closed headphone there is none as good as the Sony MDR 7506 for less than $150. Check! Not even the Audio-Technica ATH M50/50X. Yes, they can be a fun headphone to listen to. But they do not ever offer a full bloom due to their Bass bias. All equalization does is further degrade the source's sound. With neutral cans I decide if and where I want any bumps not someone else...  At 10 Oz's the M50's are a full 2 Oz's heavier and over the long haul not as comfortable as the 7506's. Nor are they as durable. Don't get me wrong, I love the ATH M50's from time to time, but they are not the headphone the 7506's are. In addition to home use I would add that the 7506 are also very portable. The coiled cable has been designed so as not to want to get tangled up with itself like so many other coiled cables. These Sony's are fully engineered. Professional indeed. Very minimalist down to their flat black finish.

I also read an extensive report claiming them to be the best pair of over-ear headphones in the $150 MSRP range.I haven't owned them long enough to say much about durability, and they may have not had enough time to \"burn-in\" (I'm not confident myself of the importance of burn-in, but it seems to be a widespread-enough idea that I do give my headphones a short burn-in), but so far I agree that they are a great pair of headphones. They have a much more even or flat response than any popular pair of headphones to be sure, but my primary comparison is my go-to pair of Sennheiser 380 Pros. They are both phenomenal sounding. The best way I've found to describe the difference is that the 380s lean just slightly towards the lower frequencies, and the 7506s towards the brighter side. The 380s have a wider soundstage, as well (probably because of the larger ear cups and distance between the speakers and your ears). As a result, there were some songs that felt more rich from the 380s...but some songs that felt more exciting from the 7506s.The 7506s have a relaxed fit, and the pads are quite soft. They will likely make contact with your ears, and I do feel some fatigue after extended listening. I have a very big head and typical sized ears, which is why I opted for the 380 Pros as my first pair...the ear cups are massive, very large and deep, and make no contact with your ears, but the headphones are heavier and grip tighter, so instead of any ear fatigue you feel a fair amount of warmth. The 7506s have padding on the speakers themselves, as well, inside the ear cup, so the contact with your ears is padded. They are lightweight and don't grip too hard. The headband is comfortable, though I noticed it tends to grab my hair more than I'm used to.I don't like the coiled cable, though it is more lightweight than the one on my 380s, so it's a bit more manageable. I also don't like that the cable can't be removed, and therefore not easily replaced.The ear cups don't swivel side to side very far, but can flip all the way around, and are on a hinged arm. You can sort of push them up against the headband (with the two ear pads together) to make the set pretty compact, and there's a basic storage bag that they'll fit in. They're fairly mobile.I also noticed that the best place to grip the cups as you put them on or take them off is covered with the same thin material that's on the ear pads. It makes me think this will probably wear out fairly fast, but that's sort of a nit-picking detail.I'm fairly new to the audio scene and don't pretend to be an expert, but hopefully this can give a wide audience an idea of what these headphones are like. I give them 4-stars for a satisfactory, but not exceptional, product. You are getting what you pay for, but in my opinion, not more.I'll probably update this review once I've used them a bit more extensively.Additional comments:I've now owned these for nearly 4 months, and have used them quite a bit.They aren't so great for using at my DJing jobs. While their mobility helps, they don't produce massive volume, and they don't isolate all that well. This makes it a bit hard to listen to songs in advance before including them in my set, with the music blasting from my system.They are, however, unquestionably, the best flat-response audio I've ever heard in headphones. No range is neglected or favored. When I mentioned earlier that they make some songs more \"exciting\" than my 380 pros, I was hearing the crispness these songs bring to audio, particularly in the mids and trebles, where other headphones couldn't seem to be bothered. I was listening to some vocal-heavy music (ie Sam Smith) the other night on another pair, and was just feeling unsatisfied...then I switched to the 7506s, and suddenly the vocals came alive. Vibrant, deliciously crisp, presented on a silver platter. Where my 380 pros still make some dance beats and music that shines with the bass cranked up more punchy, the 7506s just can't be beat in showing you the music in its pure, raw form.Another update:These continue to shine as magnificent headphones. I continue to be more impressed the more I learn about audio. I'm going to bump my rating to 5 stars. Of the headphones I own, these are the most satisfying as far as sound is concerned. I do feel like the comfort could be better, but it's not drastic enough to deny that last star. They also, as I mentioned, aren't ideal for DJing, but since they aren't advertised/meant for such purposes, I won't hold this against them either.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IZT9KERDO2B?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "There are better sounding cans, but none I trust more.", "review_helpful_votes": 9, "review_date": "2017-12-21", "review_body": "I have better sounding headphones by Audeze and Fostex but I listen to these more than either for practical reasons that really do matter.

Toss them in a bag and it won't matter what bangs up against them or how they get bumped- they'll be fine and look fine when all is said and done. All my other headphones would be broken if I'd done to them what I do to these. Third, while the pads will eventually shred after three or four years, they are replaceable. And the velour pads you can get on the secondary market are probably better than the originals. Fourth, yes, they isolate sound really well.

I do alot of video editing, edm production and djing as my main hobbies, and I would not use any other headphone. There is just something about these that reveals any and all audio errors. My rule of thumb is if it sounds good in these headphones it will sound good at the club and vice versa. Now that I have told you how much I love these they do have some major faults.1. These headphones are very cold sounding even a bit harsh especially with low quality sources like spotify and soundcloud. These are aimed at the professional audience. If you have work to do get these. If you want to sit back and listen to music buy the mdrv6 or audio technica mh50x. As an aside everyone that says these and the mdrv6 are identical must be tone deaf. The v6 sounds warm with way more bass. By comparison the 7506's are harsh and cold with a more technical (tight) sound.2. The ear pads are terribly uncomfortable do your self a favor and replace them immediately. For some reason I personally love the cloth pads from Turtle beach gaming headsets. I just hate leather and velour on headphones they make my head sweat and ears hot.3. It's time to make these with a detachable cord. Audio Technica made the mh50's with a detaching cord, it's about time Sony did the same with these and the v6's. I am writing this review because of this. I was djing at a club when an attendee (cough very inebriated human being) fell on the ground and ripped the cord right out of the ear cup. Sony is lucky I won't use any other headphone in a professional setting.When all is said and done though these are unbelievable headphones at a great price with nice build quality. Sony please just make them with a removable cord (im on my 3rd pair in 9 years and would gladly pay double the price for this one feature. Also, I hate having to get used to a new pair every few years). Finally, to sum up the review, if you are looking for good studio/dj headphones these are fantastic!

Under rugged pro use, a pair of 7506s last a decade or so unless you yank the cord out or step on them.  One caveat, however - an issue which Sony has never rectified - is that these headphones will painfully pinch the web between your thumb and forefinger while placing them on your head due to a surprisingly sharp articulation in the joint that holds the earpieces to the headband.  A simple fix is to wrap black electrical tape around the articulation, which really isn't needed to optimally adjust their fit - the articulation has no purpose other than to make them \"collapsable.\"  Walk into any major market radio station that supplies them to its jocks &amp; producers and you'll probably notice that the chief engineer has already taped the joint open.

All the way back to the Koss Pro 4A in the early 70s. I'll say right up front that I don't typically buy Sony products because, while their products are high quality and fully featured, they tend to be more expensive than competitors. I've been using and loving my Sennheiser HD 280 pro for over eight years, but when the ear pads finally disintegrated and the replacement turned out to be overly pricey I started searching for replacements.I saw a video about headphones for pros on Lynda.com and it mentioned the 7506s. The speaker liked it for post production work because they flat and true which is what I wanted. To be honest, as good as the Sennheisers were I determined after using other cans that they were not flat at all and it was coloring the sound. Not a good thing for post work and another thing pushing me toward replacement.Checking reviews for the Sony cans, it turns out that many consider them to be the gold standard for headphones and have for almost two decades. The volume of glowing reviews and the sub-C note price let me pull the trigger, and I am so glad that I did. After four days of constant use at work I will say that these are the best headphones I have ever owned. Yup. Call me a fanboy on this one. (And I'm rarely a fanboy on anything.)On Thursday, I tuned to a friend at work and told him that I was hearing stuff I never heard before. Kinda blew my mind. That may sound cryptic but all I meant was that I could hear all the tonal ranges evenly. The HD 280 pros tend to punch up the high end a bunch and the low end a bit too. The Sonys are dead flat. Exactly what I wanted.More good news.They are quite comfortable. They keep out the outside noise maybe a little bit better than the Sennheisers but without the vice-like grip they have on your head. The Sony fit is tight enough without being tedious. I wear them over seven hours each day while wearing eyeglasses and I could easily wear them for another seven. As they as comfortable as on-the-ear cans? No, but on-the-ear cans don't keep out noisy people in the room, of which we have a few at times.If you're looking for good, accurate, true sounding headphones you cannot go wrong with these.

I decided that I would go for something a bit higher end, that would last for a long time, and after doing some research, these emerged as the strongest contender. The big factor in this was finding that these don't really alter how things sound, as other headphones apparently emphasize or de-emphasize certain things which can alter how things sound. I largely wanted something that would just be accurate to how stuff is meant to sound, without really wanting \"enhancements\" that can make it deviate from how it was meant to be. The MDR7506's deliver everything I hoped they would.The songs I listened to had the same character as they did on the ZX100's, but sounded much cleaner and clearer. I found myself noticing more detail and texture in the instruments, but they still sounded like what I was familiar with. I decided to use these for a couple rounds of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and the benefit even more striking than it was with music. I noticed myself hearing footsteps and gunshots from much farther away, and it seemed like I was able to mentally pinpoint where they were coming from much more accurately than before, which was helpful. The gunshot noises in general had a lot more nuance and detail than I had noticed before. Other games, such as Sonic Racing Transformed didn't feel too different, but still sounded good. One added benefit I really wasn't expecting is that these headphones, while not \"noise cancelling\" do an excellent job at blocking out external sound due to how they cover your ear. My PC has fairly quiet fans as-is, but these block it out almost entirely (and now it feels weirdly loud when I take them off). They also take down the sound of my typing quite a bit.Overall, I'm completely satisfied with these in every regard. They sound good and feel good. They also come with a 1 year warranty inside the box, which is nice.

Sweat breaks down electronics as well as ear-pads (not to mention being uncomfortable). The other one that almost put these in the 3 star territory is the obnoxiously heavy cord. From using them on an electric piano to smart phone to portable guitar amp, the cord is constantly in the way and constantly a pain. I realize this is a problem for all corded electronics to some extent, but this thing is heavy so no matter how you position it, gravity does it's thing in short order and it is pulling on the input jack of your device (premature wear) as well as the headphones (wrapping tight against your neck and causing a lot of strain on the point where the cord goes into the headphones which means this will eventually pull out and fail).All in all, they are nice and I like them, just be prepared to fuss with the cord a lot or come up with a way to clip it to your clothes or something because it'll drive you nuts.", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R389LFNAJ2U0P1?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Put the WOW factor back in your music!", "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_date": "2018-01-03", "review_body": "I worked in radio stations for most of my career in the working world and am now happily retired. Though my duties at work were in the offices, I had daily business to conduct in the studios, so I got to visit with the DJs and production people quite often. In later years, I noticed that they were all wearing Sony MDR-7506 headphones - and that was the model that our engineering staff would provide for them. In my home systems, I always preferred Sony equipment and had purchased a pair of Sony MDR-V600 headphones. Mistakenly, I thought they were pretty good, but after I sampled first a V6 and then a 7506, I knew that the 600s were to be relegated to the pile of unused equipment.As I said, I started with the 600s and then discovered the V6s. Reading up on headphone reviews and sales sites, I learned that the V6s were making a comeback after a few years off of the consumer market, and that many recommended them for their ability to provide a true, uncolored sound. That was what I always strove for, so I took the plunge and got a pair of V6s.Still, I remembered the \"Professional\" sticker on the 7506 headphones of the DJs at work whereas my V6s just said \"Digital\". When I first looked for 7506s, I could only find them on professional musician-type of websites. Then a few years later, they appeared here on Amazon and I finally got to compare them to the V6s that I so loved.At first, when brand new, I thought the 7506s weren't quite up to what I was used to with the V6s, but after a short break-in period, I couldn't tell the difference between the two, and I now used them interchangeably. Both give me accurate frequency response across the entire spectrum of audible sound, and both continue to impress long after the initial purchase.Alas, they are not perfect. Their flaw is the material that the earpads are made of, a thin leatherette material that when new, provides an excellent curtain for exterior sound blocking. But with usage, the leatherette dries out and flakes off. This is easily reparable with replacement pads, but at a cost. Genuine pads are fairly expensive, but yo end up with practically brand new headphones again. There are other makes of pads that fit, but they color the sound differently, so I avoid those.Basically, what I'm saying is that these are so good, that it's easy to forgive the pads that wear out over time. And from my perspective, you are safe purchasing either the V6s or the 7506s, on whichever you can get the better price.

For example, cable is too long for going around (which by the way in studio is a pros), they're pretty big (which by the way in studio is a pros), the sound comes very natural and untouched (which by the way in studio is a pros), they don't have noise cancellation (which by the way in studio is a pros).

I did a lot of research before I bought these Sony headphones because they were pricey and I wanted the best sound for my hearing loss. I lost all my high pitches so I need both volume and the ability to get crisp clear sound in order to make up for my deficits. After reading review after review of different headphones, I chose these.These have large ear cups which is great because I can wear them over my hearing aids without pain. Although I usually don't wear my aids with headphones due to feedback, when I do, smaller ear cups really hurt my ears due to the pressure of the aids against the headphones. These are comfortable with or without the aids and can be worn for extended periods of time without any problems. They have a long cord which is great for me. I often workout watching exercise videos on my computer and have to have headphones to hear the music/instruction. The longer cord gives me the ability to do that although I also use Bluetooth headphones to eliminate the wires all together.But the real winner here is the sound. It's so good. It's rich and full and music sounds so good that I can't believe it. However, for me, spoken words like podcasts and movies don't sound quite as good. That is due to the amount of bass in these headphones. For normal hearing people, the bass is a plus. For me, it sort of muddles speech. Still, I can use these to watch movies and they are only slightly less clear than my other favorite headphones by Turtle Beach.For music though, wow. Very, very good. My son who is an audiophile and has $300 headphones actually feels these headphones sound as good or even better than his and that's saying something. He says speech is crystal clear for him (He has normal hearing.) and the volume is way more than enough for any application. I also find it to be sufficient.I love the headphones for music and use them mostly to listen to music. I will also use them for other things but they really are made for music and they do a heck of job making each instrument stand out and creating a really pleasurable listening experience. That is rare for me since my hearing loss makes things sound flat and tinny a lot of the time. I am happy with these headphones for music and I can use them for other applications as well.

In addition the plug is huge in comparison to a mp3 player or ipod.As far as sound is concerned? They are studio headphones! Remember this. That means that the songs will sound just like they are supposed to sound. This means that these cans do not amplify bass or treble. They way the song was recorded, that is the way they will sound. This can take some getting used too coming from other styles of headphones which are designed to amplify some aspect of sound (like bass or treb). Initially this may make you feel like the headphones sound too \"low\".  However, once you get used to all of this you will come to enjoy hearing your music just the way it was recorded. Clean and clear. Heck, you may even notice new notes and sounds that you have never heard before.

Indeed, the MDR7506 is the \"go to\" headphones for industry. Period. They are the original Xerox machines of photocopying, they are the Kleenex of facial tissue paper, they are the Listerine of mouthwashes, the Corn Flakes of breakfast cereal, the KDKA of AM radio stations.  Often copied, rarely duplicated, the MDR7506 stand as testament to the idea that good design trumps all even in this day of breakneck technological innovation.  Released some nearly 3 decades ago, they remain the industry standard.Before I continuing, let's get old thing out of the way (if only because it seems to be repeated in so many headphone reviews and provides a point of context for a younger generation or two). Yes, these headphones sound better, are better built, last longer, and will give you a more enjoyable music listening experience than will \"Beats / Monster Beats / Apple Beats / Beats by Dre\"...oh, and they cost much less.To my own ears, the 7506 provides that \"motion thump\" that is necessary to bring modern pop, rock, EDM, and other bass-heavy genres come to life.  It's not overly bass-y and certainly not distorting or loose. It's tight, rich without being too brassy, and balances the wide field into the highs naturally and with as flat a response as you're likely to hear without a laboratory.As a synthesizer programmer, lifelong player, sound designer, and enthusiast, I always describe the 7506 this way: They are the only cans that can accurately reproduce an open cutoff saw or supersaw. Period.  Everything else is relative to the 7506 cans. For those who aren't synth heads, let me put that in English: \"You hear EVERYTHING\"... and in the proper ratios and levels. Good or bad, there's no kimono to lift with filters with these cans, the sound is naked and true. If you can't mix with these, then give up on mixing even with open air monitors, you'll never hear well enough to get your room acoustics right.Yes.

I just can't find a decent use for these headphones. When you put on headphones it should feel like you've been immersed in the audio. Instead, these are the equivalent of taking two desktop speakers and taping them to your ears.Edit:I forgot to also add that these headphones WILL give you a fair amount of pain after about 40 minutes if you have slightly larger ears than average.Also disappointed that the cable does not disconnect from the headphone.

I don't find them particularly aesthetically pleasing.  The folding design is, well, folding.  As in, unless you're wearing them, they are prone to flop whichever way they please.  The coiled cable probably is useful in some situations...This brings me to the meat of my review.  These headphones do one thing very, very well.  They provide a modicum of isolation from ambient noise, while slightly emphasizing the frequencies which are important in field monitoring (or noisy studio monitoring) environments.  And they do it while sounding musical and pleasant if you just want to listen to something.I'm not an audiophile, but I have worked in professional audio production, and so I've listened to many of the competitors to these, but not all by any means.  The closest comparison I have in price and function (around $100 and closed back) is the Sennheiser HD280, which are also very good, but my preference is for the Sonys, at least sonically.  It's a wash aesthetically.  The Beyerdynamic 770s are IMO superior in sound and comfort to both the Sonys and the Sennheisers but at a higher price.I also own several pairs of AKG 240 Monitors (the made in Austria 600 Ohm version) and those are a little more nuanced and natural sounding, but of course are open and also need a lot of power to drive.

The highs are very harsh, with vocals and certain types of music actually hurting my ears at even medium volume levels. Exaggerates sibilance and sounds a bit like listening through a tin can.

These headphones are comfortable and fit any sized head, but if the cushions are not good enough more cushion-y pads are available from numerous sellers on Amazon. As for durability, these headphones are well made and solid. It is important to note though that they have exposed wires on both sides of the headphones which are small and can easily become caught or crushed if the headphones are adjusted into the storage position. This is the reason for some reviewers finding the sound stopped working on one side, as they likely unknowingly crushed one side of the wire. If these wires are damaged it may not be visibly obvious. Take them to any half-decent electronic specialist and they would be able to resolder the damaged wire no problem, Sony even includes in the box, a schematic for the headphones with all the wires shown making repair a trivial process. So, just be very careful when folding them or better yet just avoid folding them at all unless you really have to. Also, the wire is quite long which is great for plugging into your hi-fi setup and sitting/laying down 5-6 feet away.

I was worried that the phone would not be able to drive these to acceptable volume levels, but with my phone it's fine, I never get above 80% of max volume.The sound is even and well balanced, bass is not boomy or sloppy, unless it is on the track. They do a great job of reproducing faithfully what the audio engineer wanted you to hear. Some recordings are obviously better than others, so a crappy recording (Collective Soul for instance) really highlight how poorly the music is presented. Really great music is just so much more interesting to listen to with these headphones.If they break I will buy them again without hesitation. 5 stars.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCRNDQNZWTB86?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "YAY for headphones that FINALLY aren't too big or too tight!", "review_helpful_votes": 4, "review_date": "2016-05-21", "review_body": "I have a REALLY hard time with headphones because I have a small head and am VERY prone to migraines so they are always either too big or too tight.

On a side note, get yourself a good USB sound card with a real equalizer software.  Back on topic - the low end bass is AMAZING.  Does great even in the low 30 Hz range.

Enter in these Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm (Studio  Monitor) Headphones.  They are not only fantastic in every way, but cost just under $80!What is so great about these earphones?  They are super comfortable, even during endless hours of use.  The coil cord is great, and helps to keep the 9.8 foot cord untangled and out of the way.

One for me (to replace the afore mentioned $275 earphones that don't even come close!), and the other pair (still in their packaging) to have on hand, should anything happen to one of the pairs in use.NOTE: for someone wanting a deep/amplified bass experience, these earphones are NOT for them.

For the last one I would strongly recommend an equalizer either external or software (I use free software on my main pc), since gaming sounds like your shooting with a tin can. They are extremely portable and compact and jive well with my portable lifestyle. They are plastic which means they are lighter but can be perceived as a lower quality.

Not only that, but they're actually so good that while yes, you can do DIFFERENT, and you CAN do better, you can't do MUCH better. I can't remember the last time I was in a studio that did not have a pair of these sitting around for reference, and I've been in studios with some people who have worked on some pretty big things. Everyone in the industry knows them. That being said, they have a very specific sound profile. I am the kind of person who likes to explore different sound profiles in different pairs of headphones. I think generally speaking these will cater to a lot of people, but probably not everyone.The pros:-Very comfortable. Can wear these for pretty much all day without getting uncomfortable.-Great, crisp sound that will allow you to hear intricacies especially in the upper mids-Amazing price for the quality-Will last you your entire life if you don't abuse themThe cons:-Those foam pads will deteriorate with time. You'll need to replace them. I guess it depends on use, but in my case it took around 4-5 years (and the pads are a very cheap replacement). Actually, they'll deteriorate even if you do not use them.. just the name of the game. Not a huge deal.-Because the sound is focused very much on mids, trebles, and generally higher frequencies, it can get a little fatiguing. I haven't had many issues with this, but if you are using these for a while and switch to another set of \"mellower\" headphones you will notice it.As for the sound profile, as mentioned they're generally focused on higher frequencies, but the bass is still very tight and perfectly audible. I listen to literally every kind of music and they are applicable across the board, though certainly shine with rock music.I own a bunch of nice headphones that I've paid more for than these, but if I had to own one pair I think these would be the ones (although my new Beyerdynamic DT 770s are giving them a run for their money).

I don't know how much I believe in all that, but I swear they sounded less strident in the highs and the bass had become a smoother and solid experience.They are not to my liking for the brightness of the treble, which is not strident, but the bass cannot keep up.  The highs are fine, only the bass is too quiet for me and not to my belief, accurate.  If you were using these to master, you would keep messing with the bass and treble on your mixes to accomodate these headphones' negative characteristics.Positive is that they still sound balanced, and they sound good.  I think most people will notice there is quite a good sense of ambience presented by these, a rather spacious openness but the midrange, while perfectly functional, doesn't inspire.

Above the Camry, but not quite Lexus.They are extremely comfortable, I love the design.  I love the way they fold.  These are some of the most well-designed headphones I've ever seen, amazing.  Fat, thick cord that will never let you down (heavy, though!).  You can wear these for hours (I can... I have a small head, more on that in a sec) and never feel a thing.I have noticed with these, if I press them into my ears a little harder, they sound more impressive.  The bass and lower mids come up and I really like their sound, at that point.I wondered if people with big heads might be getting a better, more satisfying sound out of these because maybe the speakers press closer, thus correcting some of the bass problems I sited.Bass is there, and accurate, just not with the 'oomph' that it should have.

More recently, I've also purchased Sony's very similar (but not identical - see below)\u00a0Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones. My reason for purchasing a second pair (and getting both models) was because the V6's were very inexpensive at the time I ordered ($30 cheaper than the 7506's), and because I was curious to see if I could tell a difference between the two. In reading many of the reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, I knew that the two are constructed very similarly but there were different opinions regarding both the differences (if any) and which has the superior sound.These are both headphones in the $100 and below price category, which seems like a reasonable price to pay for high quality sound. I do not like to listen to music using earbuds, I prefer this style of \"over-the-ear\" headphone. although it does take some getting used to. I also have very inexpensive\u00a0Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones\u00a0for occasions when I don't want to use my more expensive Sony's.I am very satisfied with the sound quality from these headphones (both models), and with the comfort. They are the first \"quality\" headphones that I have owned, and the level of detail in the sound, lack of distortion, and overall quality is simply superb. I am completely satisfied.Now, regarding both similarities and differences between the Sony MDR-7506 and Sony MDR-V6, here is what I have found:- externally, they are almost identical in construction and appearance. The V6 has red stickers on each headphone \"for Digital\", and the 7506 has blue stickers \"Professional\". The phono jack for the V6 is silver metal (all metal), for the 7506 is gold (rubber and gold). Those are the only visible differences I am able to detect.- when I listen to the two headphones back to back, at the same volume level and with the same music, I can detect a slightly clearer treble and midrange from the 7506, and very slightly clearer sound. This is consistent with several of the other reviewers on Amazon for the 7506, who say they can detect a slightly better sound separation and more open sound for the 7506, with the V6's sounding a bit warmer. One reviewer also says that the internal grounding for the two headphones is different - the 7506 uses a separate internal ground for the left and right channels, where the V6 uses a single ground for both channels. (It seems to me that both grounds are going to the same place anyway, but  if this is true - and I am not able to confirm whether or not it is - then maybe this contributes to a slightly different sound).- some reviewers state that the internal speaker drivers are different for the two headphones. However when I went to Sony's website to check the specifications for the two models, that is not what I found. And here is what the Wikipedia page states for these headphones: \"both models share the same part number for their driver, but the magnet therein is known to vary. The MDR-7506 was introduced with a samarium-cobalt magnet, as is currently used in the MDR-V6. However, at some point, the MDR-7506 switched to the slightly more powerful neodymium magnet. These changes were made without changing the driver part number.\"- The box for the 7506 states \"neodimium magnet\". The operating instructions included with the V6 state \"samarium cobalt magnet\". Possibly either or both of these are out of date (as Wiki states, they may make spec changes over time) - the 7506 box is copyright 1994, and the V6 copyright is 1996.- The 7506 box includes an exploded view and parts list, which is very nice to have. The V6 box does not.- Both headphones include a soft case for storing/carrying the headphones, and both include an adaptor plug so that the headphone can be used with either a stereo mini-plug or a normal size plug.UPDATE 7/22/13 and 7/30/13: The Sony MDR-V6 and MDR-7506 headphones have just recently been reviewed by CNET, with similar comments to my own regarding the small differences in sound quality. Both headphones receive a very high recommendation from CNET. See the MDR-7506 review at [...] and the MDR-V6 review at [...]According to the specifications on Sony's website (which should be up-to-date), the only difference between the two headphones is frequency response:- MDR-7506:  - Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 10-20kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity- MDR-V6:  - Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 5-30kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivityI am not able to explain how Sony is claiming different frequency response for the two headphones if all of the other specs are identical, but this is what they are saying. And I do believe that the two headphones have slightly different sound.Although there is a slight difference between the 7506 and V6, the sound from both headphones is very neutral. The \"professional\" choice between the two seems to be the 7506, and it is the more expensive model. If you read other reviews you will find that the 7506's are commonly used by studio engineers, because they are designed to reproduce the sound just as it is, without adding emphasis to the bass as some other headphones are designed to do. At this point, for me they are both excellent, and for thirty bucks less I'd go with the V6 if I could have only one of the two.I've been using these headphones with the\u00a0Audioengine D1 24-bit digital-to-audio converter, and I am extremely pleased with the quality of the sound.As a final comment, some owners of these headphones comment that the ear pads wear out over time, and some owners also prefer different ear pads for better comfort. I also purchased a pair of\u00a0Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions\u00a0for this reason, and although I have not yet given them a try to compare them with the ear pads that come with the Sony headphones, I do like the fact that it is possible to fit different ear pads if desired in order to provide more comfort, as well as replace them when they have become worn (some owners use these headphones for many years).I notice that there are a very large number of reviewers for these headphones, many of them long-time owners who feel very strongly that these Sony headphones are the best. I'm just beginning to use them, but I have high hopes that they will be durable over time and that I will continue to be as satisfied with them as I am today.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJOQLWFO1YYNL?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Excellent BALANCED sound and clarity", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2018-01-15", "review_body": "As someone who is very particular about the sound of my headphones, these are some of the best that Ive ever tried.

I listen to primarily mathcore/deathcore/djent and various other forms of eclectic metal. Most headphones muddle the sound of the complexity and do a piss poor job of playing vocals and any synth/keyboards.If you listen to any music that has any form of complexity beyond mindless repetitive thumping, then take your Beats and throw them in the trash and buy these.My one main complaint over previous models of this headphone by Sony, is the exposed wires coming from either side, as you can see in the picture. These wires are very thin, and easy to pull out. Very easy to snag a finger or something into the small loop, and boom, ruined.

I have only ever owned these and AKG k240's, also awesome, but tried and used many others. The AKG's are incredibly comfortable, as they have much bigger earcups and a suspension system. The Sony's can be stretched to make them more comfortable (The very top band can be firmly stretched wider, worked for me), but there is no comparison comfortwise,the AKGs are like pillows. For 4 hour DJ gigs, these Sony's are comfortable enough. For long studio sessions, I go with the AKG's, especially when I'm tracking instruments (I play guitar, bass and sing as well), I forget I'm wearing them. As for audio quality, the Sony's have more presence and tighter response (i.e. mids and highs), the AKG's are a little less detailed- that doesn't mean the Sony's sound thin though, not at all, they seem equal in low frequency response to me. If I had to say which was more \"accurate\" I'd say the Sony's due to the extra crispness and detail (seems like a flatter frequency response overall to me), but that's pretty subjective, unless people are going to listen to your music on the same speakers or headphones you created it on, there will be \"inaccuracy.\" Hence my desire not to go too crazy with my work headphones, I've never spent over $100. I would only go more expensive for pleasure headphones, with noise cancelling, etc. The main thing is, learn what your headphones/speakers sound like, and mix accordingly.  The Sony's have a closed design, so they're well suited to DJing, but I still need an external amp to boost the signal in a cranking DJ setting (I always use earplugs too, which fit in these cans no problem. In-ear monitoring is honestly better, but the problem is people keep bugging you when you're DJing with in-ears, when you use headphones it's easier to ignore people interrupting you since they can see you're working). I use a Topping NX1 portable headphone amp, again not \"obsessive audiophile approved\" but very good value.  If you're looking for absurd comfort and good sound, go with AKG k240's, they're the same price, at least the older gold AKG's.

The MDR doesn't have a \"punched up\" bass like most modern headphones do; so with bass heavy tracks, they might sound lacking.On closer inspection, I noticed that the klips use a very punchy and fluid bass line and very warm vocal range to make them sound pleasing, and don't get me wrong, they do, but you lose detail.And the devil is in the details. The MDR's are the industry standard because you actually hear more. Modern music, in many cases that are mixed for autotuned vocals and bass bass and more bass might not sound as \"pleasing\" as it would on a different set of cans, but on older tracks, properly mixed modern tracks, and classical music, the MDRs really shine.It really just depends on what you are looking for. Some headphones are really \"cramped\" - no highs, no lows, must be bose, some go for a \"pleasing\" sound, and some like the MDR's go for a nice, flat, detailed sound.Really these are from a era where Sony was the name by which all consumer electronics were judged.

So many things to love about this instrument; the sound quality of the built-in speakers is NOT one of them, which was a big disappointment to me when I purchased the instrument. The point of a high-end digital like the Clavinova is that the quality of its sound recording should sound very close to an acoustic piano, but the built-in speakers make it sound tinny and fake--it sounds like the digital it actually is. I really wanted a nice set of headphones that would allow me to truly hear the professional sound of the instrument the way it was meant to be heard - clear trebles, rich bass, etc. I chose this set after reading many reviews and felt it would best fit my needs - it did. Thanks to these headphones, my piano sounds so much like an acoustic, you can barely tell the difference.

It never gives me a headache. The pads are soft and large enough to cover my ears easily-actually, they will cover my ears and a smallish set of drop earrings, too. The cord is pretty long, so it doesn't get in my way when I play, which is very important. The cord is also weighty enough that gravity prevents it from bouncing around while you are moving, while not so heavy that it would drag the headphones down.

I don't listen to any other music with it, but I imagine it would be similarly useful if you want to listen to music without being disturbed.

I must give a tremendous thanks to the top three ranked in-depth positive reviews on this site for guiding me to this purchase that was a no-brainer in the end. These headphones are about half the size of my MDR-V600's when folded up and make that old pair sound like tin cans. These have bass, but nowhere near enough to please the kids that drive around with their fenders rattling. I listen to real music and no rap at all.Since these would be traveling with me on a long trip, I first tested them on my Sony boom box hooked up to a flash drive containing all of the music that I would need. Granted, this is a low tech audio source, but that is one way to compare headphones, since faults of each set will be made much more obvious. Again, these MDR 7506 beat the pants off my old MDR-V600's and have a more authentic sound reproduction as well. The next step was to compare the two sets hooked up to my iPod Classic with the volume set to about 80% and the EQ set to \"Rock\". Again, it was no contest and these new ones win easily. I also did not have to adjust volumes for either pair. Then I got to thinking as to why I even need to bring that bulky boom box and flash drive, when the iPod Classic fits in the palm of my hand and can be charged up with my wall charger. The boom box is not what I consider to be portable, even though it takes batteries and I had only intended it to be used in my hotel room.One other thing I remembered from reading all of these reviews is about how modern CD's are too compressed. I remember when I first started to rip my entire CD collection 8 years ago and asked another music nut about the bit rate. His advice was to use 128 kbps because very few ears could detect the 320 kbps ripped files that take up 2.5 times as much storage space. So with that in mind, I chose to rip one very long song (Awaken by Yes) at 320 kbps and compare it to my version that I previously ripped at 128 kbps. I tested both versions under each pair of my old and new Sony MDR headphones and I could not tell the difference. However, both versions detected a \"mistake\" left in during the first two minutes, which sounded like someone dropped a silver dime during recording it and they just could not remove it. Under regular speakers, this cannot be heard, but this shows how a great pair of headphones can let one hear things in a song that were never heard before. Again, I thank those highly ranked positive reviews for reminding me of this.So what do I think about the few complaints on compression rates for MP3 files now?  This is nothing more than a pathetic excuse to give bad reviews to new music releases and brag to fellow music fans that they have several thousand dollars worth of equipment. For studio work, the higher bit rate is probably needed, but for the average listener, 128 kbps should be sufficient. Some of those bad music reviews also tell me that some people are just too lazy to adjust the volume knobs.Update on June 16, 2016: Oops, I forgot to mention comfort, so I tested them in my back yard this evening hooked up to my iPod Classic. Talk about concert sound that one can take with them anywhere and give the neighbors no reason whatsoever to call the police on you! I wore them for several hours and the only discomfort was from the bug bites under an approaching full moon. I wore protective clothing, but the little buggers still bit all over my hands. If that was my only discomfort, then these headphones feel like they are not even on your head. Incredible!!!! They also did not drain the battery of my iPod as I had initially feared. The cost of all the songs on this iPod make the cost of these GREAT headphones seem like nothing at all.

Then our kitten bit through the cable, so im like ok, its a sign. Clicked 'checkout' and so far have not been disappointed!Recieved them and, just as a precaution,  almost immediately turned on a super long video of \"pink noise\" on medium-low volume to try a burn-in. I made the mistake with my Sennheisers of just plugging them into my ipod and having the first song start off loud and with an abrupt snare crack, so that kinda hurt em right off the bat.But connected to an ipod is where I feel other reviews on these babies kind of combine, i.e, the \"good, solid bass\" vs \"meticulously analyzing your music\". Leaving the EQ settings on 'rock' gives a great punchiness that people like to compare to say, Beats - except garunteed these Sony's handle it much better. Everything is clean and clear, with the soundscape of a great studio recording session - tight ambience with very present instruments. Switch the EQ to 'flat', and you really hear everything with an almost perfect balance - mids, highs and lows. The sound stage widens, but everything is still very nicely present. You lose the puncy bass, but in an ideal mix the bass shouldn't be overpowering anyway. In my opinion, the flat EQ on any device is definitely the optimal setting to get the full benefit of these headphones - save adding a little bass for movies.The package warns that \"at higher listening levels, outside sounds may be reduced\". They weren't kidding! Listening at a mere comfortable level reduced my girlfriend to nothing but some distant resonance. Can't wait to try them out in the field or recording my drum covers! I feel like I'd have a much more solid playing session when able to hear a more dynamic mix of the other instruments. That being said, I keep listening to all my favorite songs through these, expecting to truely experience the music for the first time or rediscover it, as some have described. I'm not sure it's that big a jump. I mean from earbuds of anykind, I don't doubt that it is a new experience. But even if you've used any sort of high-end headphones, the difference in quality will be noticable, but not astronomical.But I didnt just buy these to plug into an ipod. I'm a musician and intermediate-level film-maker and was looking for sound dampening headphones for recording audio as well.  I unfortunately havent hsd a chance to try them out in either scenario yet, but i also havent had them very long. My only concern with them is when editing, that the flat sound will result in over-processing of the sound files dynamic range, resulting in way too much bass. I recently had my first film to be shown at a film festival and it sounded very much in the theater as it did on my Sennheisers that had higher highs and lower lows. I guess in a theater scenario, too much bass or high end isn't really a deal breaker, but it'll take some getting used to to edit with a flatter-sounding audio monitor. Which I guess in the end is really a good thing; because if they sound good through something virtually unprocessed, itll sound great on most anything!In the end, a great buy and an all-around amazing set of headphones!", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RTDLEX5OO3V9?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "FANTASTIC REALISM - ADD LITTLE BOOMCLOUD 360 FOR NEAR PERFECTION", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2017-12-03", "review_body": "I bought these based on numbers -- of buyers and reviews.  4,000.

They sound as good as headphones can probably sound. Never been impressed with headphone sound quality compared to the effect real speakers have. I have them plugged into the 1/4\" headphone jack on my Onkyo TX-SR70 receiver, which receives audio from my PC via optical cable. I like my bass to have more kick and \"oomph\" to it so I used an EQ/preamp software to adjust accordingly. These headphones are capable of producing a satisfying amount/volume of low end bass, without much distortion. And as some reviewers have noted, they have excellent \"punch\" with transients. An old song I had listened to many times suddenly surprised me with a sudden bass impact I never heard before. (Keep in mind I'm using a preamp to improve dynamic range, the only thing holding me back before was my inferior headphones..so don't expect this just plugging them into an \"ipod\".)The one thing I appreciate the most is the cord. My old cheap headphones ($30) have the typical straight cord, which is constantly finding its way into the crevices of my chair's caster wheels. The coiled cord with these is just the right length too, so that they reach my bed while sleeping at night.These headphones do a decent job at reducing external noise. Previously I had \"on ear\" headphones which pretty much acted like open back headphones, so that there was no sound isolation, and everyone could easily hear what I was listening to. The closed back design also has the added bonus of improving sound isolation the greater the SPL. Which is great for me, so that I don't have to hear my loud roommate. The only caveat is that when you take the headphones off while playing loud music/sound, they're basically like small speakers and can be heard through walls/doors, or anyone nearby.The frequency response definitely sounds flat, which makes a lot of songs sound rather lifeless. Which is exactly how headphones should be- neutral and accurate. I like my bass to have a more dramatic sound with greater impact, so in order to make songs come \"alive\" I had to use a preamp and precise EQ adjustments.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VX8B62CRN03L?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Clear Sound, Incredible Comfort", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2017-09-13", "review_body": "I haven't really owned a lot of headphones, and certainly not any studio-quality headphones, but let me just say that I was amazed at how comfortable these things are - they're easily the most comfortable headphones that have ever been on over my ears, which I'm sure will end up saving me from a lot of discomfort.

I felt pretty stupid for cheating myself out of the pleasures of good music all this time. They also feel comfortable to me after a few hours and I'm a tall person with a fairly large noggin. The fancy packaging makes me feel like I bought $500 headphones and gave me that quick passing feeling of being a wealthy person.I would say in particular my electronic, ambient, classical and choral music benefited the most. That's where I felt the ceiling and floors dropped out to reveal new dimensions. Older stuff like 60s rock certainly sounded better than before but I could also detect more flaws. If your MP3 collection is 128 bit rate prepare to be upset how bad they sound in good headphones.It goes without saying that if you're going to spend $80 on good headphones for computer use, your computer should have a good sound card.

Here's what I found:Sound:\u2022 Treble - The 7506 is a fairly bright headphone. It does tend to push the highs a tad, but I didn't mind it. I didn't find it painful to listen to, even after an extended period, and I liked the detail that it brought out in some songs. The M50 did not seem to push the highs as much, but to me, it felt a little bit more restrained and almost muffled sounding compared to the 7506. Not bad, just not as \"airy\". Overall, I preferred the 7506\u2022 Mid-range - Both headphones did well in the mid-range, but I thought the 7506 was overall more clear.\u2022 Bass - This is where I thought the M50 would win hands down. After many reviews that I read, I expected the 7506 to really get trounced here. This was definitely not the case. It could be just my tastes in sound, but the 7506 had very tight, detailed bass. The M50 had slightly stronger bass, but not quite as detailed as the 7506. I would guess, like many things audio, this will be largely subjective on which you prefer. I did not find that the 7506 was lacking at all in bass, though.\u2022 Comfort - This was probably the biggest plus for the 7506 vs the M50. The M50 felt much heavier to me and squeezed my head a lot more than the 7506. The 7506 were light and much more comfortable. Complete win for the 7506. The pair I tried had the Velour ear pads, which may have helped with this. I highly recommend those as well. You can find them here: http://www.amazon.com/Beyerdynamic-Velour-Earcushions-MDR7506-Headphones/dp/B0016MF7W2\u2022 Price - Even with the upgraded ear pads, the 7506 came in over $30 cheaper. Win for the 7506 here.\u2022 Build quality and durability - Both sets of headphones seemed very well built and durable. I don't see any immediate issues with either pair. I've heard many people with 7506 that have owned them for 10-20 years with no issues except for needing to replace the ear pads. I also read numerous people with M50s since they launched (5 years ago) with no issues either.Conclusion:Not surprisingly, I ended up purchasing the 7506. They were cheaper and I liked them better all-around. I'm sure there are other people that would do the same AB test and prefer the M50, so your mileage may vary. I actually ended up purchasing 2 sets so I could have a set at work and a set at home. Highly recommend these headphones and get the Velour pads as well as they are a very worthwhile upgrade.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RB2LHA8E343P6?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Industry Standard for Production", "review_helpful_votes": 4, "review_date": "2014-11-02", "review_body": "These have been the industry standard for audio recordists both film and television for decades and for a well deserved reason.

These are flat sounding but the best soundstage of any headphones so far.  Vocals are clearly defined without being harsh, you can visualize individuals singing on a stage or studio, each voice is distinct.  Haven't heard it this clear even with a pair of $3000 tube amps and some $7000 pair speakers. Only place I've heard it this distinct is if I was playing live myself and through our own monitors.  If you play guitar/bass and sing, it's that clarity.Ran them for a few albums and very impressed.  Linda Ronstadt Used a Denon &amp; Onkyo receivers in Direct mode.  Bass exceptional although some claim it's too flat, I think it's perfect, never muddy.Cons: Although it's very flat response, I think there's a peak in the midrange.

As a person familiar with professional headphones I can say that the level of sound you hear with these vs non-professional headphones of a similar design is unmatched. My previous headphones reached their limits and began messing up really bad so I wanted to try Sony's MDR-7506 since the really good reviews on it wasn't generic and very informative. When I first got these headphones they gave me a slight headache due to the heightened amount of new sounds I could hear from them compared to my old headphones which were more expensive than these. After about a day or two I adjusted to the new sound quality I could hear with these and ever since I have been loving it. Making music or listening to music while drawing with my tablet has never felt so great as it does now, but don't be discouraged by the price. These headphones are relatively cheap in comparison to some of the more expensive options out there, but they contain much more sound quality than the competitor brands. The MDR-7506 is very comfortable and can adjust to fit anyone from kids, teens, and adults however I don't recommend something this powerful for kids since they tend to be a little careless with listening volumes.The uses of the MDR-7506 is more than likely for professional sound recording, but I use it for everything including sound recording now. Playing games on the PS Vita and 3DS also sound amazing with these headphones and watching movies on the computer or TV via aux is really nice.

I have also tested lossless codecs and the sound is beautiful.Bass is pretty heavy on my unit. Some people are reporting no bass but i can hear the low and high bass pretty well and it definitely has a hard boom to it however it seems this is more apparent where the artist intended it and not artificial like equalizer settings.Older or lower quality songs you can hear sometimes the dirtyness of the track and the white noise in background but equalizing eliminates it.Mozart and symphony sound very nice on these.The headset is light and portable, long cord is nice as i use these at work, only complaint is the earpads can get fatiguing after a while that i do need to take a break after 2 hours or so but otherwise i even use these when laying down in bed. Quality of materials is strong and pretty flexible.

The base is deep but subtle with a lot of differing textures instead the the loud dead thud heard in so many other genres of music.

They should do even better after burning in.Listening to a live performance of a pipe organ, one is impressed by the \"airiness\" that only an organ has. It has to do with the sound being produced by wind and by the acoustics of the building in which it is housed. These headphones do an excellent job or reproducing that as well.

I can wear these for hours without feeling like I'm suffocating my ears or hurting the top of my head*The EQ seems (to me) to be optimized very well. I can hear EVERYTHING that I couldn't before. The highs are high without being piercing, the mids are ever present, and the lows are low without that cheesy HUGE bass effect like you might find in Beats.*The coiled cable is something i didn't think I'd care about, but man, its wonderful. You'll see*They fold up for easy storage and even come with a soft carry case for travel. Wonderful!Cons--*Lacks an option to change out the cord. I see a lot of other studio headphones at this price point that offer that option. Wish these did*The plastic connecting the headband to the ear pieces don't look very durable. Mine haven't snapped or malfunctioned, but I am being careful*The small wires that are exposed from the sides are a cause for concern. While I haven't had a problem, I can see them getting snagged and potentially damaged.Finally, overall I couldn't have asked for a better set of headphones and will not be returning to cheap Job Lot deals, ever. I assume if I am careful with these, I should have them for years and you should too.Oh, and a side note: GREAT FOR GAMING!

The headphones feel solid and well-constructed, and have stood up to their fair share of abuse over the past few years. I've dropped them, put them at the bottom of a bag with a 4.5lb laptop in it and then dropped that on the floor, put them in a carry on which fell out of the overhead bin, and so much more, and not only did they not break but the sound quality has not diminished whatsoever. A little bit of tweaking is required as they can be somewhat bass-heavy out of the box but that is true with any headphones.

They perform as admirably as headphones costing over twice plus they are solid, easy to fold for transport and are pretty efficient at keeping the listener isolated from outside noise.  I am using them primarily to use my iMac to access my itune AAC256 audio files and play them on the VLC 2.0.6 media player.  I plug the 7506s into an HRT microStreamer, and the DAC is plugged into one of the iMac\u2019s USB2.0 ports via an audioquest Forest USB A to mini cable.For the past couple of years, I\u2019ve been listening to music with my Dunu Trident DN-12 ear buds directly connected by their 3.5mm jack to the headphone out/optical digital audio port of my iMac.  Ever since I\u2019ve added the new headphones and DAC, I\u2019ve been enjoying a noticeable improvement in the sound quality of my audio files.The Dunus are a pretty good product, so I should mention that the sound improvement is still pretty noticeable even when I use the Dunus.  However, the 7506s are a definite step up from the Dunus, as they have a fuller midrange, a deeper bass response, better sequestration from outside noise and are more comfortable.  I\u2019d roughly estimate that about 70% of the improved audio quality is due to the HRT DAC while the remaining 30% is contributed by the improved headphones.Both the MDR-7506s and the HRT microStreamer provide a uniquely affordable solution to improve the audio quality of a basic system.  I would recommend using one or both devices to anyone who wants to significantly improve their audio capabilities without breaking the bank.While this is probably already self-evident, these two items are probably not appropriate for those with more experience and have their eyes on upgrading to more advanced audio technology.  This encompasses finding and listening to music in lossless (e.g. ALE, FLAC) or high-res (DSD) formats.  Generally, the more serious an audiophile you become, the more money you will spend.  You\u2019ll need more advanced (read = usually more expensive) technology such as a DSD capable DAC and higher-end headphones and/or speakers.  You\u2019ll also need to determine which high-end audio player (Channel D, Bit Perfect, Ammara, Audirvana\u2026) fits your specific needs the best, pay a subscription fee for access and endure the learning curve until you understand how to use the software and can then start paying, downloading and modifying your music files so you can listen to top quality audio.

I'm in the IT field. I spend about half my day talking to people, and the other half with my head down working. The trouble is, the people around me are in the same situation, and our quiet parts of the day are seldom aligned, plus we are all loud talkers, so my office is usually really noisy.The first two headsets I tried were earbud headsets. One set (Shure e2c) accomplished sound-isolation via earbuds composed of foam earplugs. Another set (from Phillips) used active noise cancellation. Both worked pretty well, the Shure being the standout for sound quality, but earbuds have a few fundamental problems.I found earbuds were a real pain to take in and out of the ear to accommodate 'drive-by' conversations. The Phillips would sometimes fall out of the ear. With the Shure headphones, I could stand to have them in my ears for about a half-day before the skin in my ears became irritated and wearing them became painful. The noise cancellation feature was great for external low frequency sounds, but did not isolate the real noise problem of background noise from other people talking.After some painstaking Googling and reading up on reviews here at Amazon ('Amazoning?'), I landed on these headphones.-Sound Quality-This was my first set of high quality over ear headphones, so I cannot size these headphones up against their competitors. That said, I was floored by the sound quality of these headphones. Previously, my favorite place for enjoying music was in the car, where I can play it as loud as I like without the concern of disturbing others (my own little environmentally-controlled acoustic bubble). They blew away any consumer-accessible home theater setup, car stereo, headphone or earbud I had ever heard previously, and instantly sold me on high-quality headphones as the ideal music enjoyment experience.These headphones are very well balanced. The lows are perfect: Strong but not overpowering or uncomfortable, present, and clear. Well managed bass is typically difficult to find in headphones, where it is either overdone or underpowered. Highs are are perfect: Clear, and not overpowering or \"over bright.\" I have never heard high 'clipping' or distortion unless it was in the recording. With well-balanced highs and lows, the oft-neglected mid tones are in perfect balance with the rest of the sound. I feel like the sound is perfect, an even, level balance, even after several years of heavy use. I hear things in music that I never noticed before (even with other headphones), like sniffs and coughs from the audience during a winter-time recording of Horowitz.-Sound Isolation-The headphones have a sealed back. They do a great job of filtering out background noise. I sometimes wear them alone (no music) just to muddle down the noise in the office and on airplanes. They work just well enough - better than nothing but not as isolating as foam earplugs (and certainly more comfortable).Good sound isolation sets the stage for good sound reproduction. I barely have to turn my iPod up to enjoy music at a comfortable level. The lowest volume settings easily drown out my coworkers and works well on crowded airplanes, also.They also do a great job of not letting sound *out.* I often listen to really good jams pretty loud at the office. When I press the ear cups together, I can barely tell they are on while holding them in my hands. Great for not disturbing people around you or for not disturbing one's partner when playing video games late into the night.-Usability-You don't need a powerful setup to enjoy these headphones. I use them primarily with an iPod, but I have also used them for gaming.They are easy to take off and put on for quick conversations.While the sound quality is excellent, and a sealed back design is good for sound isolation, they may not be so good as a DJ headset, since the ear cups do not rotate 180 degrees.-Comfort-I have a large cranium (I wear a XXL motorcycle helmet) and large-ish ears. These headphones fit great and feel great. Usually they are all the way out to the second or third from last 'click' on the headband adjuster. With the ear cups on, the headband rests on the top of my head, but has never tossed my hair.I routinely wear these for a full 8-12 hours. There is no pressure on or around my ears or on my head. Sometimes they get a little warm, but never uncomfortably so.On airplanes, I usually put them on as soon as I sit down to filter out the conversations around me, and leave them on for the whole flight, including sleeping with them on.-Durability-These headphones don't get out much. They mostly sit in a drawer at my office when not in use. I have taken them on a few trips (DC to Salt Lake City and to Greece) where they have had to endure air travel in a laptop bag and a few trips through security. They have held up very well, with no signs of wear.-The Bottom Line-These headphones changed the way I listen to music, and they inspired me to seek out a headset for gaming. I would buy them again without a second thought.I know Sony has made a successor to these headphones, and from what I've read, the sound quality on the newer headphones is not as well balanced. I hope Sony continues to manufacture these, as they are a very nice, high quality product. Why mess with perfection?I often seriously consider buying another set for home or as a backup to my set at the office.Highly recommended.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI9113SRVU2GV?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "I started playing bass guitar and needed some good phones so as to not disturb my neighbors at ...", "review_helpful_votes": 3, "review_date": "2016-05-14", "review_body": "I wore through a pair of these that I had from college (25 years ago, gulp), but didn't replace them because I had no need.

I also recently invested in Logic Pro X, which, together with my Apogee Duet, has allowed me to build up songs, track by track.  So I decided that I needed a neutral, closed back headphone set for not only playing, but also for tracking and mixing (when I need to not disturb others).  I adore my Grado SR-225 headphones, but I have never considered them to be \"neutral\", and they are about as open as you can get.  So, I started my research into what are known as \"Studio Monitor\" headphones.My search revealed three main contenders in my price range: these headphones (the\u00a0Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone, which are sonically identical to their predecessor, the\u00a0Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil), the\u00a0Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones with Coiled Cable, and the\u00a0Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones.I learned pretty quickly that the 7506's are considered to be an industry standard, but also that some consider them to be somewhat unmusical, or \"too analytical\" or something along those lines.  Fine for cold hard calculating sound engineering stuff, but not great for LISTENING to (and enjoying) music.  So, this put me off the 7506's.As for the HD-280 Pro's, there were a number of reviews where the plastic of the headband cracked after just a few months and eventually broke, which concerned me, and many reviewers found them to be uncomfortable.  Of course, there are a LOT of reviews and these were still strong contenders.  However, I got a chance to listen to these locally, and didn't really like my first impression of them--although I would definitely require some extended listening (and break-in) before making any judgement of them.Moreover, it seemed that the Audio Technica ATH-M50's were by far the best reviewed headphones of the three, and were considered to be very musical.  In fact, according to HeadRoom, they are one of the top 10 headphones under $500.  Very impressive!  So, I decided on the M50's and ordered them from Amazon.Unfortunately, I was definitely NOT impressed!  You can read my review for more details, but the short version of it is this: the M50's are not linear, have a hump in the bass at 100 Hz and another below that; have recessed mids; and sound muddy and dark to my ears.  I didn't like them at all, not for music appreciation, and certainly not for use as a \"studio monitor\", which they clearly are not.So, I returned the M50's and decided to try the industry standard, hoping that I wouldn't find them to be too harsh.  I was worrying they might be a little like the Yamaha NS10 studio monitors, which are infamous for not sounding great, BUT are really useful because, if you mix using them, and get the mix to sound decent on the NS10's, then the result will sound great on ANYTHING ELSE!  Or so the legend goes.  I've never heard NS10's.  But I was hoping that the 7506's wouldn't be like that.  And I was reassured by one review which specifically said that they weren't.  So I decided to give them a try.Boy am I happy that I did!  I wish I had gone for these first, and I would STRONGLY urge you to be skeptical of all the claims that these headphones are too analytical or that they are unmusical or any of that.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  These are wonderfully, brilliantly, clearly, and precisely musical, faithful, and enjoyable.  I stayed up late more than once because I kept wanting to hear how something else in my music library would sound through these headphones.  I LOVE that they are \"analytical\"--i.e. that they are NEUTRAL and even-handed.  It's SO NICE to listen to equipment that has an extended, and yet not boomy or exaggerated bass.  These headphones are really, really great for the price.  And they are very comfortable and have a good amount of isolation.  The isolation of the 7506's is not as good as the M50's, in my experience, and about the same as the 280's, although, to be fair, I only have a very limited amount of exposure to the 280's.In any case, there's a reason that these are an industry standard.  And they are not just popular with sound engineers; they are also renowned among musicians.  One of my friends even told me that there are albums where the V6 / 7506's are specifically mentioned as what the artist recommends that the record be listened to on.  Or something like that.  You can't go wrong with these headphones.  You really can't.  For any purpose.  And that reminds me, I should add that while I did do a lot of listening to these using my Duet as both DAC and amp, I found that the 7506's sounded really great straight out of my iPhone 4 (and out of my Korg Triton, too, of course).  The fact that these can be driven well by the iPhone definitely sets them apart and it's another huge plus for these headphones.  In my experience plenty of other \"easy to drive\" headphones still suffer when used straight out of something like an iPhone or iPod, but not the 7506's.Now, personally, I prefer open cans to closed (and sometimes I NEED to be able to hear my surroundings), so I do most of my listening to music on my Grado SR-225's or my Sennheiser PX-100's (the original version, not the PX-100 II 's, which are not nearly as good).  But I would be pretty happy listening to the 7506's as well.  And when I play my Korg, and/or compose/record, I use the 7506's exclusively and they are awesome.

I have a few that are considered up there- Koss Porta Pros, some Senneheisers, the Grado 125's... and somehow I just found out about these a couple months ago through an article on Wire Cutter, when they named them the best headphone under $150.That was pretty remarkable considering they were almost half that- about $78 on sale when I got 'em here on Amazon. The closed (i.e., sound doesn't leak) design and coiled cord makes them more practical than the Grados. And both the structural design (especially the soft ear pads) and the sound itself (I found the sound of the Sonys less harsh and sibilant). Though the Grados have more 'punch' to the bass and a little more detail overall, I think this is the more balanced, true-to-the-source headphone. It's easy to see why they're the industry standard in recording studios around the world.I almost ended up getting the Audio Technicha ATH-M50, but after reading the Wire Cutter article, I got these instead. And at nearly half the price, I'm glad I did. These aren't a pair of headphones that will \"enhance\" the music you're listening to (like the M50's) through beefed-up bass; these cans will just give you a detailed, unbiased picture of the source: nothing more; nothing less.

I wanted to like them, of course; but I did not expect to prefer them to my Grado sr-225s.  Not that they walk all over them, but they are just that bit more 'more' fuller and richer. (without being overly warm) I needed closed cans as the grados leak sound like crazy, not great in hospital waiting rooms or polite buses. What surprises me is that I want to wear these over the Grados even when I could benefit from NON closed back. ( like walking around. These seal out so much it could be dangerous, but it is all about the sound so I wear em anyway) I honestly think they compare favorable to the all metal 500-whatever line/dollar Grado phones. Though I think THOSE Grado are better, and I haven't spent much time with those I still think it's apt.  These ARE 300$ plus headphones, but now you can get them for LOTS less.I'd do it.  But one thing: these cans seem to really suppress tape hiss. This is a boon for normal listening, as it does NOT obscure treble detail or MUCH ( but SOME) 'air', but for monitoring?!?!I wouldn't. Not analog anyway. If lots of studios use this since the nineties, it may well explain the WILDLy differing levels of tape hiss between albums of similar sound quality (and even on the SAME album sometimes - especially with lots of multitracking 'mixed down') as you really aren't going to hear all the hiss that IS there sometimes(analog mostly), so how can you fix what you can't hear?  So- if I were releasing commercially sold music I'd find something more ruthlessly revealing (dunno what). They're good though. Very. And if you are semi pro, the price makes up for that by far; and if you AREN'T mixing, well- the hiss suppressions almost a bonus, then!Excellent - but the five stars would be four if these were compared to Stax phones or top drawer Senns or HI FI man ( I imagine) cans.

I adjusted the EQ for my soundcard to get my prefered bass sound for some music styles, and the MDR's have responded beyond my expectations. Through my Fender amps they are great. Initially, there was some \"rattle\" in the right ear piece with my bass amp, but after a short burn-in (2-4 hours of blues/jazz/downtempo) and a session thru my guitar amp, the bass rattle is now gone.I would describe the sound as clear, crisp, bright and rich.

No, they won't win any awards for style, nor will they make you run faster or instantly turn you into an audio professional, but they tell the truth. First, they completely cover the ears, so forget about hearing anything else while you have them on. Bass is punchy, mids and highs are easily distinguished from other components. I found the overall sound quite impressive. Compared to other brands, the sound profile of these are relatively flat, in a good way. I'm not saying that there aren't some out there that won't blow these away, but I am impressed. Also, the treble seemed a little crunchy at first. After a couple of days this seems to have evened out.They put out plenty of sound with low volume settings. The source does not have to be turned up very high to achieve ear-damaging levels, so keep that in mind. With MP3 players, that can translate into longer battery life and fewer blown headphone jacks.Feeling these in my hand, I noticed that the headband is made of spring steel and all of the mounts seem sturdy, although I have yet to test their durability. They're comfortable, at least from my observations. Wearing glasses also makes a huge difference in the comfort level of headphones. I have no qualms with wearing these for extended periods of time, outside of the slight warm feeling that the surrounds unleash on your ears.I must admit that I didn't have very high expectations at first. I did a little research before buying these and found out that these are indeed the industry standard for broadcasters, studios, etc..

Doing an A/B comparison, one right after the other, I can definitely hear a difference, but after listening for a couple of minutes to one pair or the other, I would have a hard time claiming that one sounds \"better\" or \"worse\".I do notice that the Sonys seem to somehow flatten and reveal more details of the sound. It's easier to pick out specific instruments / voices / effects from a song mix. The Sennheisers seem to gel everything together better. This might make the Sonys less preferable for general music listening, but more preferable for musical analysis.Other reviews speak critically of the durability of the ear pads. In my one hour of using the headphones, I haven't experienced this, but I don't doubt it's true. I plan to get a higher quality replacement pad whenever these start to disintegrate. (On that note, the pads on my Sennheiser HD 280's are still quite intact after years of usage.)", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5YHY3VL059DM?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Excellent Headphones for an Excellent price!", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2014-12-17", "review_body": "These are really excellent headphones!

So I thought i'd look into getting the same pair of Sony's I bought 13 years ago. And am I ever glad that I did!The Audio  - 5 StarsThese headhpones, simply put, produce some of the richest audio your ears will ever hear. Crystal clear with an impressively wide range for earmuff headphones. These are not overamplified and over-EQ'd like crappy Beats, Bose or similar brand headphones. They have a relatively flat response and do not 'color' audio like Bose do! Since these are 'studio monitor' headphones they are meant to be used in a mixing room environment to mix and produce master tracks for studio recordings. And studio producers demand accurate reproduction of audio when they work their magic. That's what these headphones were designed to do and that's what they deliver - clear, accurate audio from your source. Even at lower volumes you will still get a remarkably rich sound (unlike Beats, where you literally have to crank to get a full range of audio out of them). I've also literally worn these for hours without experiencing aural fatigue like I do with earbuds / other over-the-ear headphones.Fit / Comfort - 5 StarsI have a big noggin'. It's often really difficult for me to find any sort of headware / apparel that fits me properly, let alone headphones (they're usually too narrow). These fit like a glove. You quickly adjust the length by pulling down on the ears and that's it - you're in comfort land. They don't pinch / fatique any part of my dome either.Price - 5 StarsYou can easily pay twice as much for something twice as bad.

The ear cushions don't go all the way around my big ears, but I can put them on so they go around the back of the ear and rest lightly on the front, giving the feeling of going all the way around the ear. They fold up on themselves for storage; popping them out of the folded-up position takes some getting used to. They come with a 1/8 inch plug with a 1/4 inch plug adapter that actually screws on so it won't come undone if you happen to yank on it. I understand this particular model of headphone is a decades-old design, which just proves that you don't have to buy the latest and most expensive to get the best.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30J4LAEPAAYM3?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Not Quite What I Expected", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2016-11-11", "review_body": "These headphones have some nice features.

These headphones are very well balanced throughout the entire range. The mids are crystal and I've heard some of the clearest vocals that I've ever experienced.

I am able to wear them for a couple of hours without feeling too much discomfort. But eventually the slight pressure starts to squeeze my ears.

Those headphones were revered by many musicians and DJ's for their sound quality. When it came time for me to upgrade from my older MDRV6's, i decided to see what has changed . I found that there has been a new revival for higher quality headphones and there are old and new names making them. I discovered during my research these which were the professional models of the MDRV6. I tested a few others but liked the neutral sound the Sony's produced. After a few weeks, these I am still enjoying them and these are my observations... Sound Quality: As mentioned in other reviews, these headphones are very accurate, meaning you hear what the engineer heard when either recording the music or producing the finished product. I have listened to other brands and the difference is these have crisp highs without artificial sizzle and deep punchy bass without the sloppy boom.Build quality: overall these have a nice feel, not too heavy yet solid. Like most items I expect them to wear over time, but so far they are solid.Overall,  if your listening preference is for overstated bass, these are not for you. These headphones are for the listener who wants to distinguish a Gibson from a Fender or hear the breath of the singer on a good recording.

The MDR7506 are so accurate, for a reason, as they are studio headphones to reproduce music as it was recorded and as the artist had intended. The MDR7506 were designed this way, and not to create ridiculous highs and thundering bass that distracts from the real sound. Once again I highly recommend headphones above the other players in the game. For you audiophiles that still use records on a turntable with a analog amplifiers, the MDR7506 are the headphones for you! Oh yeah! Also well made and durable.

With a good quality headphone amp though, opens up more than you can believe.They can sound a little shrill at first, but that's actually normal. See, lower-end headphones are designed to sound good enough. Not great, just good enough. Part of this is giving them drivers with scooped frequency response. These particular headphones do no such thing. What you will hear with these is the music as it was written, and recorded. All the highs, all the lows, and certainly everything in between.

It's very easy for these songs to become muddied due to the richness and complexity of the the various ranges.  I listened to these three songs through these MDR-7506 first.  Then I listened to it through a pair of Koss UR/29s, then through a pair of Sennheiser HD 202s (because these are the only headphones I have available and wanted to compare them).  Then I returned to the MDR-7506s.When I first listened through these headphones I was stunned by the clarity and separation of the instruments and the clean character of the sound.  When I listened to these through the Koss UR/29s they were about 8-10% muddier (to my ear).  The Koss UR/29s are surprisingly clean but they seem to miss the highs and too many of the instruments blend, losing distinction, and some subtle sounds of instruments were nearly undetectable.  Still the Koss UR/29s are good headphones and sound very nice for listening to music.  For $30.00 they're a heck of a deal.  The Sennheiser HD202s actually sounded like there was a curtain between  me and the sound of the music.  In fairness these Sennheiser HD202s are $25.00 or $30.00 also.  The Koss UR/29s put them to shame.Then I went back to the MDR-7506s and I was very pleased; \"thrilled by the quality of the sound\" is a better constative.  These headphones are remarkably clear and they convey the recording as it was engineered and intended to sound.  I got them for about $82.00.  A little pricey but considering the quality of the sound, well worth it.  I would not chase the Bose, the Beats, or the other high-end offerings because I like the music presented as intended, whereas Bose loves to shape sound, and the Beats are definitely engineered for enhancing types music as well (typically the base and highs).  One last thing, these are comfortable and relatively non-intrusive on my head; that is, they're easy to wear.  The UR/29s are comfortable as well but again, the difference between these and the MDR-7506s is significant.Note: I recently purchased these so I am critiquing the quality of the sound only; if I remember to come back here in a year or two, I'll give a followup regarding performance and durability over time.

These Grado's are nice to have, though, especially as a reference sound for checking other headphones.I compared the Sony vs. the Grado with a number of CD-sourced recordings that I consider of good sound, including tracks from Miles Davis, Ry Cooder, a Mahler symphony and Orff's Camina Burana. In all tracks, the Grado's sound seemed slightly more refined, with more perceived presence, instruments more readily separated and identifiable in the mix, a feeling of slightly greater control in the bass, and a more extended high end. No doubt, if you were engaging in close attentive listening you would rather be listening though with Grado's (if you could handle wearing them for any length of time).Time will tell on the wear-ability for me of the Sony's - as mentioned my initial impression is good. These should make a good, daily use headphone for music listening when I'm engaged in other tasks.Although the packaging is intended to impress I count it more as falling into the \"excessive materials\" category.

I'm not sure. I don't believe I've tried to listen to a .flac file with these, but they seem to lack a bit of bass. Also, a non-detachable cable is a huuuuge downside for me; my cord's always go out after a year of use, so it's almost a must for any of my headphone purchases to include a replaceable cord. Only way around that is to be extremely handy with a sauteing iron. It is possible to mod it to have a removable cord, but be very careful not to ruin such a great investment.Even if it's bass is a bit low, it has quite possibly the best sound in every other regard, highly confortable, and if your careful, can mod it to be one of the best pair of headphones you could own for the money.", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAJAXTKBFDL6J?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Best headphones less than $100", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2017-03-25", "review_body": "I have owned and listened to a ton of headphones and earbuds ranging from $12 to over $400.

I wanted to wait and see how they would hold up over time. So far they've been perfect. I was considering the Grado SR-60 as I heard they had the best sound under $100, however there were quite a few things that made this pair more appealing.1. The Grado's are open backed, which may allow for superior sound, but apparently also makes your music slightly hearable to those nearby. I bought these for blocking out outside noise in computer labs and the library so I think this pair is a more practical choice as they have very little noise bleed.2. The collabsible factor is a little iffy but makes these headphones a very pragmatic choice as a they can easily collaspse and be stowed away for transport. This feature also brings up my one (minor) complaint with these headphones. The mechanism to collaspse them feels a little flimsy. Again, this is a very minor issue, but it sometimes feels as though the hinge should be bulkier for the amount of pressure that's exerted on it. It should be known that this has yet to give me a problem and I did not hear it being an issue with anyone else when I looked at other reviews for these.One more very slight complaint is that the material on the earpads can get a little sticky after listening for a while as it doesn't breathe very well. A popular option that I tried is to upgrade the pads to the Byerdynamic velour pads. With these new pads the headphones are amazing for long listening and extremely comfortable.On the whole these are a great deal at this price and are a very solid pair of headphones.

They lacked \"air\" and sounded like there was excessive harmonic distortion, possibly from reverberation inside the fairly large cans.  Choral lyrics were distorted, not from cone breakup, but from internal resonance, I suspect.  Those were returned and I upped the ante and ordered this Sony.The Sony sound is dryer, not as much low-mid, but cleaner mids and highs.

I never should have let all SIX get away during liquidation. Someone once told me that I should never pay consumer prices for great audio. Once you own professional equipment, consumer audio never quite sounds the same for the price.Anyways, as you can tell I sold my equipment and the headphones with it. That was a mistake. These headphones were the main stay of my productions, and editing. I now had to settle for in-ear buds which never stay in for me. Or, I have the complimentary headphones one gets when buying popular language learning software. (Yikes!) But I persevered through that muck for about 5 years to purchase again these headphones. My ears are in a blissful state once more! Thank you Sony for never giving up on a good product!These headphones have a GREAT sound!!! I like the other brands, you know...Senn, AT, AKG, etc. but I LOVE these Sonys. They have a crisp, clean brilliance of sound while maintaining a full, rich bass presence. Nothing is muddied unless it's in the recording that way or your amps just won't reproduce the sound cleanly.I gave SIX pair of these phones away and I regretted every minute I went without them. I am fortunate to find them here for a VERY low price of $77.XX. I paid about $110.00 for each pair in my studio.I am SO glad to have these Sonys back! Each pair is almost identical to the next in the Sony MDR-7506 line. These sound pretty much the same as my 6 pair in my studio.As far as total transparency, these phones tend to accentuate the bass while leaving the mids and highs about level to a \"flat response\" EQ setting. The closed design does help reduce ambient noise considerably. In my estimation, these PROBABLY reduce ambient noise by about 15-22 dBs.The comfort of these headphones is amazing. The foam cushions keep the drivers from putting pressure against the ears causing discomfort. They are not too tight in their fit as to cause headaches from wearing these phones for long periods of time such as in the back of the mini-van for 6 hours while watching the latest Scooby Doo episodes on DVD.One more thing...volume. These phones can take the volume without distorting on their own. Any distortion that comes through those drivers is most likely due to a bad recording or amps that cannot reproduce sound that well.You want some advice on what to purchase for headphones?

The most difficult task was working with a recording engineer in Florida while I was in Connecticut.  He would put the transcribed music on the server for me to listen to, and I would send back my comments and suggestions.  It was important that I hear the music as clearly as possible, and after trying 8 different pairs of headphones, I am convinced the Sony MDR-7506 headphones are the best available.  The only other phones that were comparable were the Sennheiser HD650s, but these cost roughly  three times more.  But I prefer the Sony's for their realism and sound stage.Sound stage is an abstract concept that is difficult to explain.  When earphones provide a good sound stage, the listener feels both left-right differential but forward-back depth.  This capability is a perception, not a reality, and has a lot to do with how well the music has been engineered in the sound studio.  But some headphones present a full sound stage and others do not.  I have always appreciated the Sennheisers for doing this well, but the Sony MDR-7506 headphones do it the best.  This gives the music a depth beyond that generated by stereo, and allows one to listen for extended periods of time without fatigue.I even recommend these headphones if all you are going to do is listen to rock.  The bass response is flat, not enhanced, however.  But I have listened to some well engineered rock with these and it comes alive.  The midrange is alive and crystal clear.

The FedEx driver is barely down the road and I can already tell you that this is my very best purchase (and I buy a lot around here) at Amazon ever!  I bought the Sony MDR7506 headphones after seeing a recommendation for them at a home studio music recording forum and decided they would be perfect for use with my new electronic drum kit - - which is still on some USPS truck somewhere between here and Florida - - so just to test them I plugged 'em up to my computer and loaded up some MP3s.  WOW!  I've been using a pair of Sony MDR222's which are always connected to my laptop for my computer listening (the internal speakers on laptops are somewhere between comedic and criminal) and always have to have the volume maxed out to hear anything.  I started the first MP3 and had to quickly drop the volume to avoid hearing loss.  Now the bass might be a little overpowering but that can be corrected with Windoze Media Player's equalizer.  Even with the compressed MP3's  - - some of which were ripped from YouTube videos and not the greatest fidelity - - I can hear clear definition between bass lines, drum beats, lead parts (guitar, keyboards, saxaphone, etc.) and vocals.  Did I say WOW yet?I can't wait to plug these up to some other true high fidelity source - or the drum kit - to see (make that hear) what these puppies will really do!  Gold plated jacks, a threaded connector where the fat jack screws on to the skinny one, meters and meters of coiled cord, comforable and replaceable ear cushion thingys, a nifty storage pouch, really neat packaging and all for way less than a hundred bucks!

These are designed to fold up and that is my only real complaint. The ear cup flips into the folded position when I take them off, and then requires a few seconds to flip them back into position before putting them on. This happens ALL the time and though the time involved is small, the irritation is not.

I am just a regular consumer who appreciates a quality product and can recognize a high value item. In those terms the Sony 7506 is a grand slam home-run.

The sound reproduction with these headphones is extremely well rounded, clear and distortion-free at any volume. I can see why these would be desirable in a studio setting. The bass is deep the highs are crisp and the mids are in full effect. These are enjoyable headphones to use for listening to music from classical to rap as well as for spoken word audio like podcasts or talk radio.Quality: So far so good. These have been around a while which speaks to the solid design. Some of the materials feel a little cheap and the overall feel of the headphones is slightly low-rent. The ear cup and headband leather feels cheap and the padding is not nearly as nice as the Bose QC15/25 (the standard for comfort in my opinion). They are in no-way uncomfortable even after an hour or more but could be more comfortable. The cord and wiring seems very robust. I would like the option to plug in a shorter cable for us on a computer or listening outdoors on a walk/hike or while travelling. The casing for the electronics however seems like pretty nice quality plastics. They seem rugged and all the hinges and hardware seem tough and I see no reason they wouldn't hold up to years of use.Value: Value is an 11/10. Seriously, if you appreciate a quality set of headphones and think you can't get good sound and/or build quality for less than $300 should rethink your headphone search.

Since I am not in the music recording business, I do not have the luxury of knowing what is quality and what is not.Worst, Like some off you, I suffer from hearing loss. As we all get older we lose our higher frequencies. In my case I feared my hearing loss would negate any beneficial craftsmanship the headset could offer. Because they are mass produced and popular, they are reasonably priced. So I took the chance. I owned a nice Bose headset years ago, but my wife's puppy chewed them up one night cutting her teeth, the little monster. I was hoping to be at least as good as that set even though they are at half the Bose cost. These are truly heads and tails above my old BOSE set.I was stunned when I put them on. Sounds I thought were lost were there and more. Now I know what everyone was talking about when they referred to sound isolation. It is like standing in a room with the musician. Instead of the guitar and the singer intertwined in a mushed melody, they separate and complement each other.

Everyone needs a bit of excellence in their lives to compensate. I think they taught me that I might not have lost as much as I thought.Is there a downside? Actually there is. I can now tell when something wasn't recorded correctly, it sounds awful. I don't how or why, but I can hear the messy result. Thankfully, only a few songs in my collection had to go. I can just imagine what professionals are hearing with their trained ears on that mess.You don't have to be a professional to enjoy these.

My other headphones (Audio-Technica ATHM40FS Precision Studio Headphones) sound somewhat flat, imprecise and washed-out in direct comparison.  The Sony headphones are superior, without question producing clearer and more accurate sound. The Sony's also weigh less on the head, resulting in less neck strain after hours of use, and they fit more comfortably but without sliding off. The Sony's have a coiled cord which is less likely to tangle or trip people.  The Sony headphones work great when plugged directly into my portable MP3 players (Sansa Clip and Coby models), do not require an adapter, and can be worn around the house because the cord is coiled and does not drag or tangle. The Audio-Technica is not practical for use with small portable devices because of the very long cord and need for a bulky adapter.  Over all, the Sony headphones sound better, fit better, work better and are well worth the extra cost as compared with cheaper products.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38PVRMUTYS1DW?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}], [{"review_title": "High quality, great price", "review_helpful_votes": 2, "review_date": "2015-01-20", "review_body": "I'm working in a small home studio where I generally record no more than two musicians or singers at a time. I needed to purchase two pairs of headphones so that I could monitor the recordings while also allowing the musicians to hear themselves. After doing considerable research, I settled on these the Sony MDR7506 headphones.First, they're widely used in professional studios, so you know they're going to have good build quality. Second, they have a relatively flat frequency response. If you're looking for bass-heavy phones, something from Beats will probably make you happier. But in a studio, the flat response of these phones really works well.I also really like the coiled cable. I've had phones with both coiled and straight cables, and the coiled seem to be less of a hassle overall, especially when you've got a dozen other cables snaking around the room to mics and instruments.Being able to easily convert from a 1/4\" jack to a 1/8\" jack is a really great feature that's fairly common on headphones like these, and it's appreciated.Finally, the price is what really seals the deal. You can find better headphones, but they're going to cost a good deal more than these.

I know you hear folks saying 'I heard things I never heard before when I listen to the same old songs' - well, in this case it is true! I really did hear more than I did with my previous pair, which were a pair of Acoustic Research Noise Cancelling over-the-ear headphones. Really pleased with the sound. I also use them for tv, streaming video,etc. and they sound just as great there. When you put them on, they by default mute sounds from the outside world, which of course helps as well.2) Comfort: I have worn these headphones for hours on end and can vouch for the fact that they are comfortable. The band is able to be adjusted, and the pads on the cups are very comfortable - Absolutely zero problems there.3) Quality: The quality of this product is rock solid. The expanders on the sides to let you adjust the sizing feels good and sturdy; you are not worried you are going to break them. The cord is very heavy duty. Definitely don't have to worry about that working itself loose or coming undone somehow. The joints where they fold (Yes you can fold them - they even come with a travel pouch) also feel ok.The one thing I will say is that these, would not be a good pair of earphones to go jogging in or other exercise type activities; The big cord and their size makes  them too bulky for that in my opinion.I have had these headphones for about a month and a half now, and couldn't be happier with them.

Having babied a well-worn pair of Sony MDR-V700 headphones for the past decade for general studio/work use, I was in dire need of a new set of cans.The 7506 has a long reputation as a solid set of workhorse headphones with above-average sound quality.  I've seen them used in countless radio and recording studios time and time again for years now.  Having logged about 20 hours or so with them thus far, I can see what all the praise is about.The fit is comfortable for longer sessions and the earphones themselves, as mentioned elsewhere, can be driven quite loudly before any audible distortion kicks in.  I'd describe the overall sound quality as balanced: highs are sharp without a piercing quality, mids are present without any muddiness and the bass is punchy and warm without overpowering the rest of the spectrum.Mind you, this is only as good as your source material, but in playing back typical 16 or 24-bit WAV audio in the studio (as well as 320 MP3s and even some older vinyl) the 7506 has done well with each source so far.  No complaints.I'd say the only caveat with the 7506 is in its design.  They're NOT the sturdiest of headphones on the market in terms of build quality.  They're considerably lighter than others nowadays which adds to the comfort factor but can be an issue over time where durability is concerned.  They do fold up for transport but the wire to each earphone is exposed - another rarity compared to other current models - though said wires are held somewhat firmly in place.I'd say the key to getting the most out of these in the long run is to handle them somewhat delicately.  My older MDR-V700s were notorious for breaking at the hinges but having babied them for so long it's not terribly difficult to keep them usable with a bit of proper care.  These ship with a soft leather carrying pouch which should be adequate for carrying these around in most situations but a hard-shell or zippered vinyl case (Slappa, UDG, etc) wouldn't hurt to have on hand either.Overall, on sound quality alone and comfort alone, the 7506 is a must-have for anyone who spends a good chunk of their life living in headphones.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VA4G82WV5D47?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Great headphones with faithful sound reproduction", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2015-08-30", "review_body": "OVERALL: Great headphones with faithful sound reproduction.

I hook them up to my iPhone to listen to the click or songs I'm trying to learn. Everything sounds great. While the db from the drums is reduced it's not muffled in a way that interferes with practice. For example, I still know if my rim click sounds right or is slightly off.I love that the 1/4 adapter screws on and off so it won't accidentally get left behind when I pack up or switch jacks.The cord does not seem like it will tangle easily and I have not had any issues yet of it kinking up and don't anticipate that to be a problem.The 1/8 inch plug housing can interfere with connecting it to a phone depending on the case you have so you may have to modify your case (enlarge the hole that goes to your headphone jack), take the case off, or what I do is carry an extension cable.I do recommend buying a case for them.I can't imagine anyone regretting buying these especially for under $100.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNS3OSZ0IAGVF?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}], [{"review_title": "... old pair of Technics headphones that felt and sounded great.

Their advice has always been good and was again. These circumaural, closed headphones replaced Sennheiser HD580 (not HD-140 as originally reported) headphones  that were circumaural, open.This sound evaluation is from the point of view of a classical music listener. The response seems to be pretty much pure, even, and uncolored across the entire audible spectrum. I heard bass down to frequencies that, heard on loudspeakers, you would feel in your whole body, not just your ears. But no headphones can reproduce that effect. The sound seemed at first hearing to be very subtly different than on the old headphones, but the ear adjusts almost immediately to this.My impression is that these are not high-efficiency headphones. You can get adequate, but not impressive sound levels from a CD-player (I've tried two different ones) without a headphone amplifier. I have not tested the headphones with an iPod or iPhone, but I would guess that the amplifier would enhance the results with either of those, or similar, productsThey are very comfortable. After as much as three hours of continuous listening, still no discomfort at all over the head or the ears. The Sennheiser headband caused an itchy scalp after a few hours of use, which the Sony headphones apparently are not going to do.They appear to be constructed very solidly. They fold up quite easily with just a little practice, and seem small enough to be practical on an airplane flight. I have not yet tested whether these will shut out enough aircraft noise to be useful for classical music listening, or whether I will have to use my Etymotic earphones for that purpose. But the coiled cable would serve aircraft use well. (It also stretches enough [ten or more feet] that I can listen to Shostakovich's 11th Symphony [a good test for both highs, lows and dynamic range behavior] on my audio system to confirm the audio response as I write this.)I don't see how the last two attributes \"Takes a beating\" or \"durable\" can be rated until I have used them for several years. But externally, at least, these phones seem well and solidly made, and I don't plan to give them a beating. (The Sennheiser headphones these replaced failed internally after three years. And I thought they were good, too, also recommended by the same specialist site, but apparently no longer available. In comparison with those, these are more comfortable and don't collect lint and dust as the Sennheiser did.In short, I'm happy with them and consider them an improvement over what they replaced, and at a lower price to boot.", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OQ6RDI71P5YV?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "These headphones are so amazingly comfortable that I sometimes forget I am wearing them", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2018-01-18", "review_body": "These headphones are so amazingly comfortable that I sometimes forget I am wearing them!

I was looking for over-ear travelling phones (as I have grown tired of earbuds). I have used MDR-V6s in the studio for two decades and have always loved their clean, try, reasonably flat qualities. They are also comfortable. Sure, the cushion material eventually cracks and flakes, but they just keep sounding great.Anyway, as a love of Blue mics, I was holding out hope for the Mo-Fis, which I ordered within minutes of their availability and primptly returned because they are so heavy (see review). I continued my search for a short time before putting on the V6s, suddenly realizing that the answer for my travelling needs was already on my head. Shopping Amazon led me to discover that the MDR 7506 cans were about $15 cheaper (and are basically the same). So, I used the savings to buy a pair of the Beyerdynamic velour pads (much softer and cooler).They arrived about an hour ago and haven't left my ears since. The 7506s compare favorably with every set of headphones or earbuds I have ever used; Sennheiser, AKG, B&amp;W, Etymotic, Shure, and now, Blue. They sound amazing with little or no coloring (I want my audio to sound like it was recorded). Pus, they are light enough to wear for hours (half the Mo-Fis), fold better than most over ear phones for traveling and they hold up. They are efficient enough that my iPhone and iPad drive them with plenty of leftover head room.Apparently, the proverbial \"wheel\" doesn't need to reinvented. Now, my V6s live in the studio and the 7506s travel in my bag.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33P07H7A70USU?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "The best old school headphones for audiophiles!", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2018-04-21", "review_body": "Excellent headphones!

I just recently learned that ear pad replacements were available through Amazon and purchased a pair to replace the ones on my now older 7506 (which I gave to my wife to use on her computer and Kindle Fire).

Overall the MDR7506 is a great sounding headphone that is extremely neutral and is good enough to mix with as well as field/DJ work like the V700's.  The build, however, does not seem as solid as the V700 nor has any styling cues.

I still recommend resting after mixing for a while to allow your ears to return to baseline. Get them, even if you have $10,000 headphones. It doesn't matter. They are a useful tool, not gimmicks.

What I really wanted were the Sennheiser Momentum but I could not afford those. Based on reviews, these seemed the best in the sub $100 range and they were on for a good price on Amazon.TL;DR: These are good earphones but not great. Everybody carries on about how they are as good as a pair of $200 cans but in my experience they are in the same league as my DH205's and only ever so slighly better. I vastly prefer some more high end cans.PROS: Clear sound. Not muddied at all. Very good noise isolation.CONS: Treble is way too hissy and sibbilant. I need to turn volume down on high treble tracks. Uncomfortable ear cups (maybe because I have big ears? After 20 mintues I really wish I could move these things or take them off).In the end they are actually quite good. I mean the sound is good.

In the end I ended up buying both. I can honestly say I love both for different reasons. I would say the sound quality of the MDR7506 is amazing. While the same is true for the Sennheiser  headphones in the treble range, in the bass range a lot of instrument timbre is somewhat lost. Which is not to say that the level of bass output is low, because the bass can get pretty loud, but the ability to tell what instrument is producing a very bass note is kind of lost. The reason I love the Sennheiser headphones is that they are extremely comfortable! After using the sony headphones for more than a few hours my ears start to get kind of sore, however the Sennheiser headphones remain comfortable after 4+ hours of straight listening. As far as durability go, the sennheiser headphones seem like they can take more abuse than the MDR7506 based on the fact that the MDR7506s have more moving parts and exposed wiring.

As a current ATH M50X user, I think both these models produce phenomenal sound for both producers and casual users.

I can wear these for several hours and my head/ears don't hurt like many of my past headsets. The padding also blocks outside sounds a decent amount so I find myself often uncovering 1 ear and the headset adjusts and pivots and is still comfortable to wear.

I play a lot of games on my computer, talk with friends on software and listen to music and movies/shows. I'm no audiophile but I have been able to compare how these sound vs other headsets. I feel like for the price they are really good. Most of my other headsets have been for gaming purposes and I will drop $60-80 for a good headset. (I've had several plantronics, a steelseries and logitech headsets). One of my plantronics sounded a bit better than these. In comparison, these sounded flat, like it was missing the fullness of a layer of sound. Honestly though, time has pasted and these sound pretty good so I don't really care. That plantronics also broke at several joints.Overall; TLDR: Most comfortable headset I've ever had, very durable and in the price range sound really good. I've got these and my Yeti microphone so I'm good to go for the long run. I'm done buying headsets every year or 2.Picture of the headset looking good as new more than a year later.Edit: The ear pad wrinkle material has started to tear and flake off. The great thing is, they are replaceable, which I have done. Good as new.Update 10/12/17 : Quick new update.

These aren't intended for everyday listening, but I use them for that, too. The fact that they're studio monitors means they give the listener exactly what the studio engineers and musicians wanted the audience to hear. I prefer that to boosted bass B.S. even for bass heavy music like hip-hop, EDM and pop. If you don't know what studio monitor means, look it up so you aren't surprised by these. The cups are comfortable and are easily adjusted to any size head. I wear them for hours, and they never hurt my ears. The one con I can think of is that the closed back means they get hot fast.

They are honest, transparent and incredibly useful. The badmouth on 7506's is they sound \"harsh\", \" too sterile\", etc. These aren't for listening to your Kanye playlist while hiking or \"bassing out\" on some Dubstep. These are professional audio TOOLS used to mix,  check recording quality,  track overdubs, etc. They are made to be honest, flat and unflattering to recordings with faults so they can be addressed. I got my first pair in 1994 and those boys are still working great. The only thing was recently spending $10 or so here at Amazon for replacement earpads, now they look new just like the pair I just bought from here a few months back. The new ones will take some \"breaking in\" as the first few months the drivers are still settling, etc. These headphones age incredibly well because my 20+ year old pair sounds just as tight and true as the new pair but a certain roundness and expansion of the stereo image is present, really cool. Sony 7506's are essential for checking mixes and excel in isolating sound while overdubbing vocals and mic'd instruments. Even mixing is great on these...of course nearfield monitors are the rule for mixing but if you \"know\" and learn the way 7506's sound and react it is entirely possible to produce awesome mixes without a monitor in sight. Try really listening to classic albums that have reputations for being recorded and mixed extremely well and you will soon \"get\" why 7506's are so essential. Albums like \"Who's Next\" by the Who, \"Aja\" by Steely Dan, \"OK Computer\" by Radiohead, \"Full Moon Fever\" by Tom Petty and \"Abbey Road\" by the Beatles are prime listening lessons. Most of those records were made on analog tape and in studios without the DAW ease of today as digital  crystal clarity but 7506's show you how the engineer/producer/artist carved out the sonic space and frequency zone for each instrument. Go to school on stuff like this and your own favorite stuff and then when you check mixes, track and even mix with 7506 headphones you'll have so much insight and experience to apply to your projects.Sorry for the novel but I can't put these over enough, truly exceptional tool that any audio pro should have. The only thing even close are beyerdynamic DT100's but they don't have the sound stage and dimension that the Sony's have. And for non Recording &amp; Pro Audio enthusiast's still reading at this point I think if you can accept going in that these aren't gimmicky noise cancelling, \"extreme bass\" headphones, 7506's can be great for hearing how the artist produced the music and intended it to sound. I know I'd rather have these than some beats by dre for an international multi-hour flight anyday.In closing, these aren't necessarily headphone versions of the venerable Yamaha NSM10 monitors but like those  studio standards 7506's can give honest insight into what's right and what's wrong about what you're listening to.Highly recommended.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IG57ZIUH1V8M?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}], [{"review_title": "Durable, Comfortable, and Provides Quality Sound", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2016-04-06", "review_body": "I really can't say enough for these headphones.

I did take off one star because of the discomfort. I have average (if not smaller than average) head and ears, and these cans are just barely circumaural. The right cup barely fits comfortably over my ear, but the left one does not (guess how I know my ears have slightly different sizes?). So after about an hour of being pinched, my left ear would become red and irritated, and well, that can certainly distract me from enjoying music. I'm hoping that after a while, they will loosen up a bit, but as I already have them for about 2 weeks, I don't think there's much of that, so I'm considering returning it for another different pair. I'll give you an update later.To sum up, if you have larger than average (I'm curious to know that the official \"average\" ear size is), you will experience discomfort during and after use.

For the price, I would like to see padding on the headband or perhaps a more comfortable fitment system (they don't quite fit my head perfectly).Overall, if you want a great set of enclosed headphones, you will be very happy with these.", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMF36CJ5AI15Y?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Best Headphones I've ever owned", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2013-01-09", "review_body": "Finally got the headphones that so many budget audiophilia were raving about.

I use these for at least 2 hours per day, and I am not sure how the earmuffs could even flake or slip off, as they feel like a sort of leathery material and are well secured.

I do see there is some reinforcement where it plugs in, to help prevent it from shorting out there. .Overall the sound quality is great on these.

But my overriding criteria in rating headphones is SOUND,  The lower registers are tight and solid without being overdone, and the mids and upper-mids seem perfect with great voice presence and absolutely beautiful reproduction of acoustic guitars, woodwinds, etc.  If I had to nitpick, it is that the very high registers (for example, massed violins) seem a little \"tinny\", but a few minor tweaks to the equalizer seemed to pretty much solve that problem.Bottom line, I really like these headphones and highly recommend them..", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26VUCVG7CASYS?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "A bit bright but still a studio standard", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2014-01-17", "review_body": "I went back to these headphones as my vocal booth phones of choice after a brief affair with a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50's.

They sound extremely clean, and have a tight a punchy bass but its not overpowering at all. Great for mixing and overall music production, or if you just want really flat sounding headphones these are great. Under $100 I think these are the best music production headphones you can get in terms of sound and build quality. Sure there are better options, but for what I paid ($79.99) its hard to beat. I do have some complaints though, which are very minor. The way the headphones fold up are great, but if your not careful they can snap out of your hands and fold up really hard and it will flip the ear cups and they get scratched. I had a friend wearing them and he scratched it this way, although its never happened to me. Also the cable is fine, I wish it was detachable but whatever, it functions fine and the only problem I have had was that the coiled cable gets caught on the arm of my chair and will snag and its noticeable but once again, MY chair does this so it doesn't apply to everyone. Now for my biggest complaint- if you move your head sometimes the top part of the ear cups will touch the top of the base that holds them in and makes a noticeable tapping sound and recently has been bugging me more than ever. To put it into perspective, it sounds like tapping your finger nails on plastic when you are bored, but maybe not as loud. If you keep your head pretty steady it doesn't really do this but if you rotate your head as if to look upside down (just in that general rotation, by no means am I wearing headphones upside down) they will touch and it makes a noise. You could fix this by taping some sort of soft fabric like felt onto that area, I just haven't done it.

Listening to music, you can hear nearly every beat/note and hear every lyric (as clearly as the artist is singing them).The only thing I'm not too fond of, is that they do get hot to wear. Because the material used for the padding is not very breathable. It gets quite hot when using them. If in a well air-conditioned room it's not as bad.

You're a videographer and you edit your own videos, you work with voiceover for small commercial work, or you mix music on the side. If you fall under these, stop looking for headphones. Just buy these already.Here is what I like. With the way Sony packaged these headphones, I felt as if I had bought a crown jewel. I was very impressed by the the packaging. I expected them to arrive in a cardboard box and protected by a plastic bag. They came in a nice-ass sleeve and pillowed by a friggin' nice piece of fabric. As consumers, too often what we buy is abused before we even get our dirty hands on it. These, too sound cliche, seemed to have been handled with care by Mr. Sony himself.  Plus it comes with a nice little nylon or leather case...that I'll probably never use. But still.So the headphones themselves. Amazing. They feel professional. Heavy duty. I was choosing between these and a Sennheiser model. I'm glad I chose these. Several days later, I noticed one of my fellow videographers had the Sennheiser and I immediately noticed how flimsy and light they felt. The top part was all plastic. These have weight to them.  They do not weigh your head down; they just feel as if they could take a beating.A con...if you could call it that. You're not going to be traveling easily with these. They aren't compact. But if you're looking for something mobile and compact...then why are you looking at monitor/editing headphones? These will sit and stay at my computer.So, buy these. I am not one to praise products. Seems everything is crap nowadays. These are not. This, I think, is the only review I've ever left for a product because I am so impressed with them.Lastly, do put in a good day of using the headphones.

They've been around for nearly 25 years, and have proven themselves in harsh production environments. There is a good reason Sony keeps making these headphones after all these years. They are quite simply the best headphones on the market for under $100. Bass is deep and tight while highs are crisp and clear. The frequency response Sony claims is accurate, and they are quite sensitive. They don't need much power to produce great sound.Sony also deserves credit for including a nice pouch and supplying a gold-plated 1/4\" adapter. The packaging is great too. You can't go wrong with the Sony MDR-7506 Headphones. At this price point, nothing on the market can compete with these cans for audio and video production.

That buys you a little bit of peace of mind; in case they don't live up to their near legendary reputation for reliability.If I HAD to point out something that I didn't like, the only minor gripe that I have is, while they are foldable and come with a carrying pouch, making them somewhat portable, the cord is too long for a lot of uses. I know they're professional headphones and that the extra cord length may be needed for mixing boards and the like, but it prevents me from using them in situations where having that much cord to trip over isn't acceptable. In a perfect world they would have a breakaway cable so you could use different lengths/styles of cord for different applications.I can't imagine needing more from a set of headphones than these are able to provide.

I know this horse has been beaten to death, but it only took a short amount of listening to realize the differences.  But, before I get into it too far I just want to say that both models are excellent headphones; and it's amazing that either set can be had for less than $100.And a WARNING to all buyers.  Because these phones have been around forever, and because they are so popular (I think Sony sells more than 35,000 pairs of these a month) there are lots of fakes out there.  You can research this on the web, but the safest way to insure you are getting the real deal is to make sure that when you purchase here on Amazon you only buy when it says \"Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\".  It is the easiest way to be sure you're getting the genuine article.Everybody hears differently, and everyone \"listens\" differently.  We don't all enjoy the same types of music, and similarly, every set of headphones is not necessarily suited for every genre of music.  We all own different source components, and most of us have a limit as to what we are willing to spend on our gear.  I believe every headphone review should include a brief summary of the reviewer's musical tastes, sources, and gear and should always including references to other sets of cans they own, have auditioned, liked, or disliked.  With so many variables affecting peoples like or dislike of any pair of phones it is my goal to help those with similar musical tastes and similar gear to determine whether or not these headphones will be a good investment for them personally.To that end; I listen to music in practically every genre.  I tend to go through different phases, but I enjoy Mozart as much as Metallica, 80's one hit wonders and New Orleans Jazz, Lady Antebellum or Lady Gaga, Eminem to Zedd.  Music has so much to offer in all genres that one could spend a lifetime discovering new things they like.  I use my computer to play all the usual manner of digital files, and an Onkyo C-7030 CD player to handle disk duty.  Both feed into my Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp.  The digital files via USB and the CDs via analog RCA (the Onkyo has excellent onboard D/A conversion).  I have also been playing around with a Little Dot MK2 ii Vacuum Tube Amp (which I am really starting to love).  It should also be noted that I use no equalizer to modify the sound of my music (because I don't have one available in my setup).  My headphones include Sony MDR-V6s and these MDR-7506s, V-Moda Crossfade LPs and M-100s, Audio Technica ATH-M50s, Beyerdynamic DT-880 250ohm Premiums, Sennheiser HD 598s and HD 600s (my personal favorite) as well as my 4th pair of Koss Porta-Pros (easy to exchange when you live in Milwaukee) .  I've tried Grado SR 80s and SR 225s (just too darn uncomfortable), some Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro 250ohms (I prefered the DT 880s), and my son even owns a pair of first generation Beats Solo phones (Yuk).  The other day I threw away some Denon's (no clue what model, but circa 1990) and a set of Sony MDR-V600s that were both totally worn out.  I also own lots of buds as well (my Klipsh X10s being my favorite).Like I said at the beginning, these headphones sound great.  They are by far my favorite set of closed phones.  The crossfades are fun (they'll make your teeth chatter), but the sound is very unnatural.  The ATH-M50s sound excellent as well, but I prefer the Sony's more natural midrange.  I like them with most genre's of music, but I prefer them with classical, jazz, adult contemporary, jazz rock, and other similar genres of music.  The 7506's (and V6's) also give the widest soundstage of all my closed cans.  When comparing the sound to the V6's I would say this.  Both models have some of the most natural sounding mids I have heard in a headphone.  The V6s have more bass and noticeably higher highs, where the 7506's are flatter through the audible spectrum.  That's pretty much it in a nutshell.  It isn't hard to hear the difference, and you can see it as well by going to Headphone dot com's \"build a graph\" page and comparing the two.  The build a graph is an excellent page and when I look at the graphs for the various phones I own it shows exactly what I'm hearing myself.  I have heard many reasons for the differences between the two sets of Sonys from wiring to cup shape, and I've read all the references to the parts list that says they have all the same pieces, but all I'll say again is that there is a difference.  If you like a flatter sound with less of a \"smile curve\" then these 7506's are what you're looking for.  If you like a bit more bass and treble I'd recommend the V6's (though the highs can cause fatigue after a while).  If you are looking for cans to monitor or edit video then the 7506's are the ticket.  It's amazing how accurately they can playback the sound I record with my video camera, and it's no surprise that you see these on the heads of people in the movie business when you watch behind the scenes extras on DVD's and Blu-Rays.  I have taken the V6's to work and I use them with my little Nuforce uDAC-2 as the two pair together very well, and the 7506's are my go-to phones at home when open cans won't do.  The phones are very efficient as well.  They play plenty loud without a lot of power, though they sound even better with a nice amp.  They are also very revealing.  While you will hear lots of details in your music, you will also hear all of the flaws.  Music with accentuated highs may also sound shrill and sibilant when using these phones.  If you want lots of booming bass you'd be best to look elsewhere.  The 7506's have nice low, accurate, detailed bass, but they aren't thumpers by any means (nor are the V6's). If you want some serious thump on a budget watch for the V-Moda Crossfade LP's to go on sale (you will sacrifice detail and clarity, however).The build quality is excellent and I'm alright with the earpads wearing out and needing replacement from time to time (I'm on at least my 5th set in 2 decades with the V6's).  All earcups need to be replaced sooner or later, and if you shop around you can find the Sony replacements for a cheap price.  If you opt for some of the velour replacements that are out there you will (or you should) notice a change in the sound (I've tried them with the v6's).  It's also important to watch the foam part of the cups that covers the driver.  If it starts to break down it will get pushed into the holes in the front of the driver itself and it will ruin it (this is what happened to my V600's).  The phones are very light, the comfort is excellent, the clamping pressure is pretty light, and the sound isolation is really good too.  I also like the coiled cord and the quick change screw plug.  I have never had an issue with my cord on my V6's in almost 20 years and I don't foresee a problem with the 7506's.  The carry bag is handy and surprisingly durable as well.  I do wish they locked in a little tighter when you opened them as they often seem to want to close back up while trying to put them on.  You also have to be careful for the right side wire as it can get pinched in the whole works and possibly become crimped.You just can't go wrong with The 7506's or the V6's at the price they sell for.  You just have to decide which response curve you prefer.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I61IQYXIQV1S?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Amazing headphones for editing", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2015-03-30", "review_body": "These are by far the best headphones I've ever owned.

I found the sound to be very balanced, everything is in the right place. In my ipod I had to turn down the bass ! My only concern is a slight exaggeration of some high frequency tones as in some rock songs the hihats and cymbals are a bit too pronounced (for my taste). Sony MDR7506 is unforgiving for the quality of recording, low quality/low bitrate music (like in some online radio stations or youtube) will be a pain to listen in these ones... not that you would do it by choice anyway.Comfort ... I am wearing them now at work when I am working on my computer and it is not tiring at all. I can wear them all day.I tried to replace the earcushions to velour once, as the leder-like material makes my head sweat ,  but it made everything much worse: sound, comfort, isolation from outside world.

I think I have finally found a good compromise with these Sony MDR7506 phones. First of all, I import all my music with a lossless codec (file size be damned). I do not need every recording I own on my player at the same time. And I have always felt that when listening to music I want to hear the music as it was recorded and not the device that is producing the sound. The headphones (or the speakers) should be transparent. To a large extent these Sony phones accomplish that. They have exceptional clarity and detail through all frequency ranges with a natural organic sound and minimal coloration.  And when I can hear the picks on the strings and the rosin on the bows, I know I am in the right place. I also find them comfortable for extended wear and like that the cord is coiled and not too long.

I would not pay that price for these again.Now these sell half the price - and they are worth it!I will not buy another pair of Sony-phones, because Sony builds a lot of electronics - none of them built to last, sadly.As with a lot of other mainstream-brands.To sum up: Worth the price, but they will not last - if you want something you can have for years and years i recommend to check out the audio-devoted brands instead.I would recommend that actually, before you buy these - that's where im going next.Goodbye Sony - we've had some beautiful times, but quite a short romance.Have a nice day, friends!", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3W0EGS6FL7F48?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "absolutely awesome!", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2013-03-01", "review_body": "I didn't realize music could sound this good!

Let me tell you my story.I come mostly from in-ear headphones, as I run, walk and travel several miles/kilometers per week.I enjoy listening to music, talk shows and TV series. But I personally prefer a good set of speakers than headphones. Or at least I used to! Generally, I listen with headphones when I feel speakers bother my girlfriend or coworkers, but with these headphones: no more!My relationship with Sony headphones is vast but always on the lower price range. I've been with the brand since the late nineties. I've tested some of them and most of the times they lasted long enough for me to feel like it was time to get a replacement.Lately, however, I've switched brands. First with the Sennheiser CX-300 II (broke them in less than a year, cable problems) and the more expensive (but rather cold) Etymotic Research MC5 (didn't enjoy them, they hurt my ears).Now I decided that I should get a new set to use in the office (about 3 times a week, as I work twice from home) and leave them there.I received them two weeks ago and I noticed Sony's copyright is from 1994! These are almost 20 years old! And they sound better that anything I've tested before.I tell you, it is impossible to leave them! I can't listen to any other headphones if I know I can use these ones. They are incredible!Sound quality is so clean and natural, whenever you try others, you'll feel them artificial or unbalanced.These are perfect cans for the money and I feel my only upgrades are at least twice the money (as the Audio Technica ATH-M50 or the Beyerdynamic  DT770).They sound neat, mostly strong in the middle, good on bass (but not excessive) and perhaps a bit bright on the high side, but the overall result is amazing.Sometimes my ears get a tad hot, but I got used to it. My next upgrade are the Beyer EDT 250 pads, I've read that they help with the heat problem.I walk with them on, no problem at all.I love the long, strong and coiled cord. I am not afraid of breaking it, which is always a worry with the in-ears.The whole package feels and looks sturdy.Best choice I have ever made. 100% Recommended buy. Stop reading.

These headphones deliver about the most clean, accurate audio reproduction I have ever heard, throughout the entire frequency range.The audio seal around the area is amusingly superb. You can be standing right in front of someone, see their mouth moving and it's like they are miming. If you set the headphones to a pretty nice, full volume, and then take them off and allow the two ear cups to close against each other, the music disappears, demonstrating how good the audio seal is around the ear cups when they are on your head.  I think this really helps with allowing the sound reproduction to reach your ear drum without contamination from outside noise.I use these for audio monitoring mostly for video production professionally, but I can't help but use them for music while working at my desk.There is ONE minor complaint I have. There is a little Achilles heal with the wire going from the headband to the ear pieces. It seems contemporary technology and engineering should be able to hide/contain/conceal them without so much external exposure without quality loss. But alas, certainly makes me watch for snag and catches on the wires as I shuffle them around. I wish the wires were more concealed. But because of the way I use them (I am not continually packing them for travel or things like that), it does not hamper my usage of them, hence I keep 5 stars.Considering the cost, these headphones could easily be double the cost and still be an outstanding value.

There are so many options out there, it's a bit bewildering. Thankfully, the mdr7506's can come to your rescue. I'm not an audiophile, but that doesn't mean I'm not a discerning listener. I was just an average college student, looking for good vibrations on the cheap. It was basically between these and the senns that are in this price range (280?). I decided to go with these, and I haven't regretted that decision yet.These cans are pretty comfortable to wear. My ears do tend to get hot for extended listening sessions, but it never gets to be uncomfortable. It is like a breath of fresh air when you take them off though. The 7506's are made very, very well. I won't go into any technical details, since you can read those for yourself. I can't imagine them breaking down unless I sit on them or something. Their quality is vastly to superior to my friend's Bose triports. His look like a toy compared to mine. I love the professional quality of the cable. This may seem like a minor issue, but it's really very important. the cable doesn't really pick up any noise from banging it up against a desk or wall for instance. It's also very thick. I hate those flimsy, thin cables found on lower quality headphones. I also like the fact that it connects to the headphones through only the left side, instead of both. I wasn't a big fan of the telephone-like design at first, but it's much better than having a really long cord. The padding is fairly comfortable, and the best I've every experienced on around the ear headphones. The headphones also do a nice job of filtering out external noises.The sound quality is great. The sounds is flat, but this isn't a bad thing. This leaves all of the tweaking up to you, unlike other competing brands ::coughBosecough::. the bass is pretty healthy on these headphones, and you can of course get more juice out of them by adjusting the bass levels of your songs. The sound is very clear, with a good representation from the lows, mids and highs. It has really brought my music to life. There were so many details I had never heard using cheap phones. You will be motivated to go back an re-rip all of your music at a higher quality, because these phones will make any low quality rips PAINFULLY obvious. I've stopped listening to some of the songs that I couldn't re-rip because it was basically torture.These are great pair of headphones, and probably the best pair you can get without spending at least $100 more.*why a 4 rating?

So let's rate.Comfort: As far as high end over the ear headphones go that are noise reducing these are very comfortable. The metal band makes adjustment easy and you won't have to fiddle with them too much.Design: The coiled cord design is the usual for a studio monitor so mobile it may not make sense to have. The ear cushions aren't water proof either. These were designed for professional studio monitoring and are often used by live sound guys on the sound board. They have a low OhM so most sound cards can drive these without much of a problem. If you're just looking for nice sounding audio without the extra stuff these will serve you well.Sound: This will wildly depend on your sources of audio and your soundcard. Mobile devices such as laptops and phones don't usually come with digital to analog converters DACS to really bring out the functionality of high end headphones and most streaming services have low quality streams. Things you couldn't hear in cheap ear buds will now be apparent so you'll have to update your music collection and how you listen to it if you want to walk down the road of the audiophile. However, these are at a low OhM resistance so you can just rely on your mobile sound cards if you like and it will still blow your mind.But What If I'm Already An Audiophile: Maybe you got a pair of Beats or Bose and heard there were better cheaper and nicer options on the market and these came up. What can you expect?Sound Signature: These aren't basehead cans. The bass is there but in products like beats the low end is over stated. Sony has always had a warm sound signature and engineers have even complained about the inauthentic emphasis on the high end and it hugs it in and gives it a nice warm hug. However, this is where no review on earth is going to help you as sound signature preferences are wildly different from ear to ear and without being able to test them yourself you'll be reading a lot of writer pros on the matter.  I love the warm sound signature of Sony and these guys really produce beautifully for acoustic music and vocals but they disappoint not in the low end as I'm not a bass head who needs my ears thumped off (which someone with beats might have experienced and gotten used to) but I do have one major complaint about these and it's sound stage. Sound Stage is important in Hi Fi and to me is one of the most important things. That's where I'd say pre existing music fans and audiophiles might have turmoil with these. They are flat for a reason, studio work, and they're not meant to be an expansive listening experience. Just a good one. Bose and Beats which is many people's start in this world have more soundstage and are built for enjoyment listening so if Sound Stage matters you need to consider the ATH 50x instead but those also favor the low end and have a colder sound signature.However these are fairly \"inexpensive\" headphones for what they can do. They produce beautiful audio, and they don't reprocess the music. I know most music lovers have at least one pair of these famous headphones in their home somewhere they are loathe to part with so that says a lot about them.My opinion is that getting a pair if these won't ever be a waste of money, and when or if you get upgradeitis these will still have a place and a use in your music equipment collection.For the price and the sound they product, the comfort, the mobility, and the accurate sound reproduction minus the milf emphasis on the high notes, these at edge absolute unrivaled best in their price range.

I needed a \u201cclosed\u201d headphone so NO sound (for listening enjoyment only) could be heard by people around me.  I\u2019m somewhat of an audiophile and an ex-band director\u2026so perfect sound is important to me (note: I listen to concert band, jazz, orchestral movie soundtracks, choral, classical, and even some pop/rock/country).  My \u201ccontrol\u201d for testing was music from my iTunes Library (apple Lossless files) on my laptop with advanced soundcard.  I wanted to spend fewer than $200.  Here are the following results:1st place:  Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. (score:  90/100 points)  Pros \u2013It does a variety of tasks really good with no real weakness at anything.  It\u2019s best for listening enjoyment\u2026not professional studio monitoring as advertised.  It has very warm sounding vocals, a balanced sound (with very slight favor to lower mid range &amp; upper bass), and comfortable (loose) fit on my ears/head.  It handles thick, polyphonic music passages with ease without distortion\u2026while keeping the main melody/vocals volume and tone quality still cutting through with warmth.  The sound feels like you\u2019re in a very large professional concert hall!  People with large heads will appreciate the fit of these comfortable headphones.  Cons- Although you have the feel of being in a large concert hall, the distance to the stage seems a bit too far away\u2026perhaps the 30th row.  These headphones are the highest price of those tested (around $170\u2026ouch\u2026 but, it comes with 3 different chords to the headphones/ and bag).2nd Place:  Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. (score: 88/100 points)  Pros \u2013 Very balanced sound throughout the registers\u2026no favors to any register!!!  It can be used for both studio monitoring or listening enjoyment.  The extra-deep bass extension can be \u201cfelt\u201d during musical passages\u2026nice.  This Headphone has as a very \u201clive\u201d performance sound\u2026like you\u2019re on the 5th row during a concert.  Best headphones for listening enjoyment under $100 (only $99!).  Cons \u2013 The tone of melody/vocals sound a bit thin or \u201celectric\u201d at times during thick/polyphonic textures in musical passages\u2026especially male tenors and trumpet/alto sax solos.  Although you feel like you\u2019re on the 5th row during a concert, it sounds like you\u2019re in a small auditorium rather than a concert hall.  Fit may a bit tiring after a long period (good clamping pressure).3rd Place:  Sony MDR-7506.  (85/100points)  Pros - These headphones must be the best at studio monitoring\u2026or when you need to be critical and \u201cdissect\u201d music\u2026every detail can be heard throughout every register (you can even hear faults in the recording you never wanted to hear before).  The sound feels like you\u2019re in a closed room with a live band)...not a performance concert hall/auditorium (there is a lack of reverb) good for recording professionals (and only $86!).  Very clean and articulate at the \u201cattacks\u201d of instrument/vocal notes (not much sustain with these headphones) throughout all of the registers.  Cons \u2013 Very bright sound\u2026taxing to the ears after a while (Treble is very pronounced).  Must use an equalizer to add bass/warmth to the sound for listening enjoyment...Yes it\u2019s a pain, but then they do sound good after those adjustments.4th Place:  Bose SoundTrue, Around Ear. (80/100 points)  Pros \u2013 These headphones have a good, balanced sound throughout the registers (Note: you will have to turn up the volume on these headphones).  They are very comfortable and \u201clight\u201d on the head\u2026.you almost forget you have the headphones on.  Cons \u2013 Sound is very \u201cspeaker\u201d sounding...like you\u2019re at a concert to hear your favorite band  in the 50th row, but the stage is full of speakers playing CD recordings of your favorite band; therefore, there is just too much distance from you to the stage.  Price is too much for this headphone ($150).5th Place:  Koss SP540. (75/100 points)  Pros \u2013 These headphones are very cool looking, and somewhat comfortable (I have normal/smaller ears).  The sound is not balanced\u2026favors the bass/mids\u2026good for rock/rap lovers.  Mids and treble sounds have been somewhat muffled\u2026so the bass and lower mids \u201cboom\u201d throughout your music.  Cons \u2013 Feels like you\u2019re sitting behind the band at a concert.  Not worth the $150 price tag.  Note:  I have a Koss 35 Pro A and love the sound of these headphones (but they are half-open designed, not fully closed) and I hoped these sp540 models could compete\u2026disappointed.6th Place:  JBL J88a.  (68/100 points)  Pros \u2013 These headphones are the most comfortable\u2026no competition in this department!  Bass is very heavy\u2026.rap/rock lovers will appreciate these headphones.  Cons \u2013 The mids and trebles have been purposely muffled\u2026almost non-existent...feels like you\u2019re sitting behind the band during a concert (with cotton in your ears).  Price is good ($99), but come on\u2026try to have some balance throughout the registers.7th place:  Grado SR125. (65/100 points)  Note:  This is the headphone I\u2019ve had for a couple years...and why I started a search for a better headphone.  They are not what I needed because they are \u201copen designed\u201d\u2026thus, people around you can hear them.  Pros \u2013 Very crisp and clear mids and trebles\u2026you can hear every detail.  Comfortable fit.  Cons \u2013 no bass what-so-ever\u2026thus, bright and airy sound only.  It feels like you\u2019re sitting on the 75th row at a concert!

The 7506's internal wiring is a bit different, using a separate ground for the left and right channels, rather than the single ground for both channels used in the V6. I like the sound of both 'phones, so I bought both. To my ears, this difference in the wiring gives the 7506's better stereo separation and a more open sound, but the V6's sound a bit \"warmer\". All in all, great headphones--I just wish they were somewhat looser on my size 7 and three-quarters head!! They do seem to be loosening up a bit. Maybe they just need more time. Love the solid construction. I got the V6's first, on the recommendation of a former co-worker who told me he's still doing his daily airshift with the same cans, after 20 YEARS.

I wasn't satisfied with in-the-ear and mass market consumer headphones mainly because of the sound quality and general discomfort after briefly using them. So I did extensive research and ultimately it came down to the Sony MDR-7506 headphones.The quality of sound and comfort is the best that I have experienced so far. Since these headphones are capable of near-complete representation of music, I was able to hear more nuances in music with these headphones compared to regular headphones aimed at consumers.From what other reviewers have said, the ear cups of these headphones may tear and wear out easily. I don't have this problem yet, but fortunately the earcups are replaceable. In the package there's a service card that lists all the replacement part numbers in case something breaks.More importantly, these are analog headphones, regardless of what the big print on the packaging says. Therefore, the quality of sound may vary depending on what hardware you connect the headphones to. However, that doesn't make these headphones inferior. In fact, all other competing professional audio headphones operate on an analog signal. You just have to pay attention to the impedance, which is measured in ohms. This particular model, the MDR-7506, has an impedance rating of 63 ohms at 1 kHz, which happens to be adequate for most computers and audio equipment. But if you want to maximize audio quality even further, you have to connect these headphones into a standalone \"headphone amplifier\" or a similar device that enhances the analog signal strength. This is not necessary for most people, because the audio quality will most likely be already hi-fi on your hardware.

Not a big deal, but it's a little uncomfortable.

The cup can be put back on, but not without some hassle. It stays on for several days/weeks but then will come off again (seemingly at the most inconvenient time!).I highly recommend these headphones for their sound quality.

I am very impressed with these Sony's. The sound reproduction is excellent, and there is no distortion at high volumes. The lows are there as they were intended, and the mids and highs are crystal clear. It is also worth noting that they are fairly comfortable. They warm my ears a little bit, but nothing bad. Otherwise once you have them adjusted, you can hardly tell that they are on.I consider myself a bit of an audiophile, and I enjoy good sounding music. These 7506's are the first that I looked at, followed by the V6's. These isn't much of a difference for the \"average\" listener, but the V6's do offer more on the low end and are a little more \"warm\" in that regard. The 7506's are sharper. Overall, I prefer the 7506 more, and they are really just a newer version of the V6. At the time I purchased these, the 7506 was about $15-$20 cheaper, so based on what I heard testing, I went with these. If you are debating the 7506 vs. the V6, I would go with whatever is cheaper at the time. For under $100, these are arguably the BEST you can buy.If you are wondering about all of the \"break-in\" stuff, I personally don't believe in it, but everyone has their own opinion. To \"break-in\" any headphone, I just use them how I normally intend to use them. Overtime, you can pick out minor differences with listening time, but that is just your ears getting used to the sound. Break-in or not is up to you, again I don't believe in 100 or more hours of breaking-in with special tracks, just use them how you will use them.I use these on my computer, Sony CD burner, iPod classic, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, as well as my old LXI series stereo from Sears with a separate amp and EQ. The best sound comes from either the CD burner or the stereo, but those have more power output compared to a computer or iPod. However, these headphones also work well when powered by a computer or iPod. However, if you are using these with MP3's or others of the like, you MUST make sure that you have a good quality file. 128kbps is the MINIMUM! If you have the room, go for 320kbps MP3 or a \"lossless\" file. These phones will ruin a poor quality file. The best way is to either rip a CD in 320 or lossless or buy high-quality MP3. I don't encourage illegally downloading music, but if you do, that's your choice. Just make sure it is a good, large file or you will regret it.Well, I think that should finish my review.

The sounds are crisp, they're comfortable, and fairly light. They even dull outside noises pretty well, which I was a bit surprised by.Sound- I have used a good amount of over-ear headphones, and these are the best I've tried. They look very neat and professional, don't need batteries and are WELL worth the money. All of my previous headphones were less than $100 so I cant compare these to anything super-fancy, but these were the best I've had by a landslide. Comparing these to my last pair of Skull Candy G.I's ($80), I immediately noticed the sounds were brighter and significantly clearer. I was able to hear instruments/sounds in songs that I did not notice at all with my G.I's, which says a lot about these headphones considering G.I's are much better than average headphones. I even could comprehend background lyrics in a song that previously (a day prior) sounded like mumbling. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the amount of bass and low bass these provide, I have not heard any  comparable non-battery operated headphones (which sometimes distort, so watch out).I produce house music using FL Studio, and these headphones have made my mastering and EQ'ing MUCH more precise. There's never even a hint of distortion, even when using some high quality, CPU gobbling VST plugins and heavy kicks. There is a reason most sound engineers use these headphones, these are the real deal. If engineers use these to master, you can be assured that this is the way their music was intended to be heard.Practicality- The wire is thick and durable, no worried about it fraying, and the coiled wire can stretch pretty far if you need it to. It does not take up any more space than other over ear headphones if you tuck in the wiring into the collapsed structure. I personally don't like running with headphones on, but it seems these fit snug enough to run without a problem, provided you have some of that cable in your pocket. Like I said earlier, they're pretty light and quiet some outside noise. These fit comfortably on average sized ears, but I would imagine are also good if you have larger ears because the cushion is very softTo sum up, I guarantee you will not regret purchasing these.

A lot of research for the right phones for a couple of months, the reviews about so many of them, a visit to the local shop to try out a few reputed ones... and finally going with my gut feeling about these ... And i'm glad I chose them... The delivery experience was butter smooth ...well packaged parcel, before time delivery ... and once I opened the box, it was then that the real magic would start ... Really a comfortable grip ... nothing so tight as to make me have a headache, and no falling around stuff either ... Very balanced cushiony texture ... excellent noise isolation ...  AMAZING SOUND AND VOLUME ... especially evident after having worn about 100 odd different branded headphones in the last 10 years or so ...

There are also aftermarket earpads that people seem to like better for $20 that'll solve this problem. There's an obvious reason why these have the rating they do on amazon and why thewirecutter.com continues to recommend them and despite me thinking it's mostly nonsense, why audiofile blogs continue to recommend them as well.For my ear, a lot of treble is extremely annoying and I like a lot of bass. These headphone fit the bill perfectly as well as providing great clarity in the midrange. You won't get the ear fatigue from listening to them for a long time like you might with headphone that have excessive high end.

You'll love them!***December 8, 2012 update****I have owned these headphones for awhile now and I just wanted to do an update.  There is good and bad.  The good is that they still sound wonderful, out of one ear, I'll explain.  The headband has held up, it looks great. The cord is still fine, the ear cans are fine, all in all, they are a great pair.  Now for the bad.  The wires on each side of the ear are exposed which I find is a bad design because these headphones like others fold up for storage.  Well, after using them for awhile I noticed the right ear started to crackle.  Upon inspection, I found that the wire on that ear had been crimped from the parts folding on it.  As I have stated, not the greatest design. I tried to fix it by soldering it, but it didn't work.  So I have no sound in the right ear piece.  The only other thing wrong is that the ear pads are disintegrating but that's easily solved with buying a new pair of pads.  Sadly I won't be buying another set of these headphones.  I'm now looking at the Audio-Technica ATH M-50s.

I remember trying some mid-to-upper end Sony headphones about 12 years ago and I went with a set of Koss TNT-66, which I believed at the time were the best overall headphones for the $75-100 range.  Since then, I've tested a number of headphones (Panasonic, Pioneer, Bose, Sennheiser, and even some buds), but I always came back to my Koss for clarity, bass-mid-highs reproduction, and sensitivity (how loud they play).Only recently, the magnets on the Koss headphones seemed to be getting weaker, and I noticed less punch in the bass.  I started researching various headphone reviews in the $75-150 price range.  To make a long story short, the Sony MDR-7506 had satisfaction ratings that blew anything in the price range.After using the Sony's for about a week, I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers.  These headphones are extremely accurate in reproduction of bass, mids and highs.  Bass is solid and very low, without sounding boomy.  Mids and highs have a remarkable 3D presence, even better than the Koss.  Sensitivity is good, so even portable CD players or IPods can power the headphones, although these puppies are so good that I really recommend them for use with a good home audio or home theater system.  The reproduction is so faithful that the limitations of compressed music (mp3's, etc.) are apparent.Anyway, my recommendation is that these headphones are better than anything in the under $150 range (and sound better that a Bose set for $159).  They may sound better than many headphones in the under $250 range.But don't try to save money by buying a cheaper set of headphones.  I've been testing many of the $25-50 headphones for years - and don't waste your time.  The Sony MDR-7506 is a real set for professionals - and discerning home audio enthusiasts.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KLNJLXH5CIA6?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}], [{"review_title": "and am very glad I did", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2014-11-24", "review_body": "spent hours looking online, reading reviews, etc. for a replacement to a 10-year old pair of these exact same headphones. then I ended up buying them again, and am very glad I did.

I\u2019ve owned two pair to this date and I enjoyed both. They provide a really nice sound, they\u2019re comfortable, and they\u2019re very portable because they collapse into themselves.PACKAGING:The headphones come in a beautiful packaging. They com in a box with really nice gold trim on the inside and a carrying pouch as well.COSTRUCTION:Overall, I\u2019d say the headphones are constructed very nicely. Real leather wrapped band, aluminum cups. The pads on the cups are made of a pleather like material and I ended up replacing them with some Beyerdynamic EDT250V pads. WONDERFUL set up!Something I don\u2019t like about the construction however, is the 3.5mm jack. It is VERY easy to bend. I\u2019m talking crazy easy. It\u2019s why both pairs of my headphones broke. They still play sound, but only out of one side. Another thing I don\u2019t like is that the band can warp if you store them in a backpack or something. It is pretty much impossible to bend it back to it\u2019s original shape as the second you put them back on, they feel weird.SOUND:The sound is pretty good. Good enough to do some vocal tracking and listen to music. I wouldn\u2019t recommend mixing with these though as the sound isn\u2019t really neutral. It\u2019s slightly colored and accentuates the highs and dulls the lows. I have a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pros that I use for mixing and recording and I find them to be much more true to sound when it comes to instruments.Overall, I think these headphones are a good buy for those looking to have a nice pair of headphones to listen to music with and record vocals with but I would not recommend mixing songs with them.", "review_rating": 3, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HXY9WF1ZNQE9?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Sounds like you spent hundreds of dollars!", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2009-01-14", "review_body": "You'll wonder why you spent so much money on speakers, once you've listened through these headphones.

They punch weigh above their weight. Can be driven solidly and accurately from small usb powered amplifiers, offer surprising fidelity from headphone output of a decent CD player but scale well with better sources and amplification. This headphone is no different in that respect. The build is the same. A red \u201cprofessional\u201d sticker on the cups versus the mdr-v6\u2019s \u201cDigital\u201d. That\u2019s literally where the difference in build begins and ends. A sticker. Popping the cups open may and probably does reveal more  that causes the subtle yet firmly present change in sound signature. As with the v6, the pads being the same; kind of suck but if you\u2019re invested in these, dekoni makes a utterly delightful pad that while expensive is ridiculously comfortable without screwing up the sound signature. I can\u2019t hear any changes meaningful enough to be able to convince myself it\u2019s there for the better or worse that the dekoni pads effect anything at all.Efficient and accurate, I do feel the 7506 is a little more analytical, not cold or lifeless by any stretch but certainly geared more for the professional requiring accuracy and neutrality but that doesn\u2019t exclude the casual listener or music/headphone enthusiast even the budget oriented audiophile can get a lot of enjoyment from this particular set of headphones. I hear these to be a little more mid range; maybe not forward or emphasized but certainly more mid centric than the mdr-v6 which in and of itself has a very pleasant mid range. The bass; the bass is different. The first evening I had them. I played Aretha Franklins Ain\u2019t no way. I kept hearing these super low tones and thought they were coming from behind me. Kept looking over my shoulder. It was bass I hadn\u2019t heard in the same track before. I played it over and over and it\u2019s the same sub bass, in the same places. Very low. Solidly around 20Hz. Impressive. Not overpowering, flabby or booming but present in justbthe kost convincing way. I feel there\u2019s a difference in sound stage, maybe it\u2019s just in separation but it does feel a tad narrower but still wider than I expect a closed cup to be. Still; to me anyway a very entertaining headphone.Enclosed is a \u201cservice manual\u201d of sorts and a parts list of the entire exploded headphone and some online research shows this headphone is certainly rebuild-able maybe even scratch built with parts sourced online. That\u2019s handy if your both a headphone enthusiast and tinkerer. More online research nets very little information on Sony\u2019s website regarding either the mdr-v6 or this set of phones. Only posts under \u201ccommunity\u201d so the fate of these headphones, possibly the provenance may be questionable. I am confident both pairs of mine are genuine and both this and the v6 sound wonderful in their own way. Really a solid purchase. I really wish I\u2019d known about these Sony\u2019s and the koss portapro when all I had for music was a portable CD player/headphones and a binder full of discs. I\u2019d have probably never gone over to the dark side with MP3\u2019s.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K6QQVZPSS4AG?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "The good and the bad of MDR-7506 'phones", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2010-12-18", "review_body": "I've owned a pair of SONY's MDR-7506 headphones since April of 2009 and find them to be very much as advertised.

Getting it back on was a lesson in aggravation.Recently, the coiled main cord of my MDR-7506s got stuck between my couch and an end table. Although I didn't yank it brutally, the amount of pressure I did exert in trying to free it was enough to short out one of the channels. In a case like this, especially when they're out of warranty, SONY does not repair the headphones-- they only offer an eighty d\u00f3llar exchange, plus sales tax and shipping.If you are capable, it may be cheaper to buy a replacement cord, splice it in high on the wire, then solder and tape it up.

They are more or less industry standard, among a few other options.That means if you are listening to really nicely produced music, it'll sound good. If you're listening to crap recordings, they'll sound worse than they normally do. So, just be full warned that they do not hide anything with sound coloring (equalization or shoddy tone production). I personally think they sound great but your ears may say otherwise since they are fairly \"flat\" and don't color the sound.For prolonged listening, they're not the most comfortable. That's echoed across the reviews. There are other ear pads that might help with that, but some of it just comes down to the nature of over-the-ear headphones. Some people like ear buds better (I usually do) and some people's ears can't tolerate those so, your mileage may vary.I use them primarily to monitor sound recording for video, for that purpose they are amazing. It's much better to get rid of unwanted sound before post-production and these will almost overemphasize imperfections in your initial recording. They don't hide much if anything. If your mix or your recording sounds good in these - it's probably going to sound amazing on a television or consumer grade earphones/laptop/even high end stereos for the most part.The sound reproduction is VERY flat to my ears. I'm no audiophile but they are flatter than most headphones I've owned to be sure and they are even flatter than my M-AUDIO monitors. That said, they're also very accurate and have crisp sound reproduction that are rare in a set of cans in this price range.Quality wise they're awesome. They're reasonably comfortable.They are NOT noise canceling headphones and if you're trying to drown out a coffee shop or airplane noises, you probably want earbud type headphones to block out sound(I recommend the SoundMagic E10 with comply ear tips for a very good value option--though they're not flat and do have some sound coloring which I find pleasant for music).The coiled cord is a very nice touch. The bag it comes with is too, but I found it to be fairly terrible in terms of look and feel. I'll probably seek out a better case in the future for the road. The bag is not really great for road use as it's -- just a bag.I got mine directly from Amazon and they were of course authentic. Mine were made in Thailand.For my purposes (mostly monitoring recording) these are EXACTLY what I want. I just caution those of you who think that buying studio headphones is going to make your music \"sound\" better that these MIGHT not be the right thing for you. Though, if you do, you might find that after a little adjustment that you prefer them to your old (probably fairly \"colored\") headphones.

I wrote reviews on each but basically the Sennheisers sounded good but were uncomfortable, and the ATs were comfortable but didn't sound good. Both sent back.Round 2, based in part on the recommendation of a friend, was these. These I am keeping. Sound is quite good on all but the most difficult material, and sounds like it has a flat response curve. Bass is tight and not over-prominent. Mids and highs are good, again with the exception of difficult material where there is a certain lack of musicality. They don't sound \"bad\" on this material, but they don't make my ears go \"ahhh\" like the HD650s do. Which is to be expected, given the price difference.Comfort is quite good. Band padding is a little lacking but they are quite light and it doesn't seem to bother me in practice. Build \"feel\" is good. Not luxurious, but workmanlike and no impression of delicacy or shoddiness.My one complaint is the coiled cord. Sony, make another version of these with swappable cords for another $15-20.

My friend bought this pair of headphones 18 months ago. He never really used them, so I borrowed them for a year. Amazing headphones, loved them. Fantastic sound distribution. I eventually gave him that pair back.I purchased my own. I was really taken back when I first heard them. There was a significant difference between this pair and the pair that I fell in love with. The mids and harmonies were REALLY strong, but the highs were nonexistent. The bass for both headphones was similar. I had a hard time hearing the melody over the harmonies.I returned that pair in exchange for another because Amazon is the best. The new headphones arrived today, and I am still trying them out, but here is my initial impression: These new headphones now are extremely heavy on the top melody line and the harmonies are very muddy.

Unlike most of the other buyers, I use them for scoping court cases (court reporters hire me to clean up their transcripts and correct misspellings and similar mistakes). Some of the audio I receive is awful. These headphones have made my job so much easier.Comfort: I wear these for up to ten hours at a shot sometimes (small breaks in between) and they do not pinch or crush or cause pressure points like most other headphones I've tried. The cushioning all the way around makes for great wear over long periods of time. My ears might get a little warm, but it's a small price and easily managed by taking a short break and letting them cool down.Sound: I'm not an audiophile and haven't given them a serious test on that end but my husband is and regularly steals them from me to listen to his music when I'm not working. For my purposes, they are amazing. I have one reporter whose courtroom only has one mic in front of the witness stand that is also supposed to pick up the judge and both attorneys who often sit at their tables across the courtroom. To hear anyone other than a witness, I have to max the volume and deal with hissing of the volume that high. In other instances, a witness may speak very quietly and the judge or attorneys will only periodically ask them to repeat themselves and speak up. Using the same laptop with same sound card, I can much more easily pick out quiet voices and what those voices have to say than the former Bose and Sennheiser headsets I had, both of which cost more than three times the price of these. For some reason, every pair of \"noise canceling\" headphones I've tried gave me headaches and they also did not help pick out those overly quiet whispers or people too far away from their mic (it seemed to make it harder to hear those very quiet details). The padding on these not only help with comfort but effectively create a noise canceling effect without the downsides of true noise cancellation.Since I started using these, my accuracy has gone up quite a bit. A few of my reporter clients have commented that I pick out details they had to listen several times to confirm and I can often do it on the first or second listen.

The Sony MDR7506 is the closest thing to a open studio monitor I've ever found in a set of headphones.  The clarity and definition and presence, solid bass and punch allow me to hear darned much everything in my audio now!  Thanks to Sony, I finally have a $300 dollar pair of studio grade headphones with only an $80 price tag!  I'm also hyper-sensitive to the phasing of headphones.  Many sets I've tried over the years seemed lacking in punch, volume or clarity because they weren't in phase with my eardrums.  Now the Sony MDR7506 has lifted the \"audio fog\" and the set reveals the true audio tone to me.They work great in front of my AT4040 microphone too, which is ultra sensitive to the presence of the \"cans\" on your head.  The Sony's are barely audible in the vocal mix.  The only way to do better is step up the price tag about 4 times to get a perfectly sealed ear cup.  But for the money, the Sony's are technically superior to anything else I've tried in the \"under $100 dollar\" range!  If you're on a budget but want superior cans, get them, you won't be disappointed.  The only beef I have with them is the fold up design.  I could live without that and find it a handling nuisance, but for the performance it's a small quirk to put up with.  I wish the fold out design would \"soft lock\" so they will stay in position while putting them on.  Then if you wanted to fold them, then you would have to push them together in a certain way so that they go in their nice leatherette carry case.  Nice touch, but since these headphones are in my studio all the time, I'll use the carry pouch for some loose camera stuff in my camera bag.Good value and professional performance is the bottom line here.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTXWMT7CTON9A?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Awesome Sound", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2018-10-21", "review_body": "Best $79.99 I've spent all year!

My ears stick out, so after an hour or so I can feel them pressing in, but it's fine as long as I take them off every once in a while.  For people whose ears don't stick out, this isn't a problem.The sound quality is great, especially at this price point.  I prefer the sound on these headphones to many priced much higher.  These are the best headphones I can listen to without a headphone amp.  Higher quality headphones emphasize background noises more and need it.  They also cost several hundred dollars more.  I can plug these into my noisy PC at work, and music sounds clear and detailed without overemphasizing any frequency band too much.  I can hear all the bass easily without it being overpowering.  If I want more bass, I can simply adjust the EQ on my sound source.  The fans and the hard drive in the PC produce white noise that's clearly audible when no music is playing, but once I hit play I don't notice it.  Using a headphone amplifier eliminates the white noise, but I don't feel the need with these headphones.  Everything just sounds good through them.The long coiled cable is fine for an office or a bedroom, but it can be cumbersome on the move.  The headphone do fold up nicely, but they have fragile-looking wires connected to the drivers that makes me hesitate to throw them in my bag.  However, if you treat them with care, you can get away with using them on the bus/plane.They isolate fairly well.  I can still hear people talking nearby, but when I turn on music I can ignore them successfully.  They also do a good job of staying quiet for people around me.

Low-End Bass was way too punchy, and at times over-whelming.b.) The highs were way too tinny and competing, which washed out the mids.Point is my Grado SR-80's were a 5 out 5 out of the box.Since the initial impression I have have been burning them in with pink-noise, low, mid, and high frequency sweeps. I will provide an update after burn-in period is complete (24 Hours).I bring up the Grado's because weather you have the 60's, 80's, or 125 series out of the box they sound warm, well-rounded, with soft high's, and even lows.  The major issue with the Grado's is PAIN.  I have had three pairs and I cant make it past 20 minutes without my ears feeling pinched.These are the second pair of Sony Can's I have purchased. I have the MDR-N60 Noise Cancelling (got on sale in an outlet store).  Those were very accepatble out of the box, however the noise cancellation circuit actual adds noise, so I decided to move up to the MDR-7506 Professional's.Build Quality and Design:a.) These MDR-7506's are well built as far as material qaulity for the price point.b.) Design - There are exposed wires connecting the left to the right can. The issue is that this wire comes out as a loop and is about 18-gauge, which makes me nervous if they catch on anything since the wire is so exposed and at a high-gauge.  I am assuming that this was part of the design which allows the headphone to be fold-able, which by the way, is a smooth and clean action.c.) The cord - The compromise for having that expose wire connecting the two cans is that you have only one side cord-out.  I love having the one-cord design (Which is the other thing about the Grado's which is uncomfortable - two mid-gauge cords dropping from each can).  This cord also has the coil built into it to limit the amount of strain at either end.  The 1/8\" and 1/4\" male inputs are nicely gold-plated, and the 1/4\" connector actually screws onto the the 1/8\" part, nice touch.d.) The Cans - Good, but would sacrifice an extra 1/2\" -3/4\" of depth for a definitively comfortable fit.I know I am being critical considering the 100.00 price point, but these are one of Sony's high-end Headphones (Seen them as high as $229.00 in retail stores).  And I also recognize that I am comparing The MDR-7506's features and benefits to a $500.00 headphone standard.After Burn-in and a few weeks of listening I am expecting the bass will be less punchy, and the mid's will be more pronounced, however that remains to be heard.  I make my initial impression and 2 week impression without a DAC, or any digital signal enhancements.", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSW6SWGU0OVTG?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "... in the past 15 years and they're still my favorite headphones to reach for when I listen to music ...", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2014-10-06", "review_body": "You can keep your A50s I've had two of these in the past 15 years and they're still my favorite headphones to reach for when I listen to music or game or sit at a console.However a slightly updated version with a detachable cord, and the ability to use either a 10ft curled cable like the original, or like a 3 foot braided straight cable for pc or phone use would be a nice touch.

It was more dynamically correct than the V-Moda, and about on par with the Sennheiser HD 380.To add perspective, I love trio music, such as Bill Evans, and it was a very good test of the headphones, challenging that the bass not be overly forward, and with sparkling highs that let the piano show through.Perhaps if I had not been hearing the great sound of nearly all of these headphones, it would have been more satisfying.

They are comfortable on the ears. I must say i have not worn it for long: may be a max of 2 hours. I did not feel uncomfortable while wearing them. The build quality is amazing. It feels sturdy. The quality is very good too.It sits in a compact pack so its easy for taking around. I will need an year to comment on the durability.

I also enjoy listening to music (mostly rock). So these headphones serve many purposes for me. I have had them only for a few weeks now. I have others by different manufacturers, and a lot more pricey, that have shorted out or have been a lot heavier. I am really enjoying these phones. I can wear them all day and not get too bothered. The only thing I found so far that I don't like is that my ears sweat and I wish I had some foam padding for breathing ability around the earpiece. But then again, I probably wouldn't get the great sound out of them. These are flat, if you want booming bass go with another maker. These don't artificially model the sound.

Previously, I used a pair of Status HD Two. While HD Two was a great pair of headphones, I had its plastic headband snap after regular use. Status Audio replaced it for me, and the second pair broke as well. I decided to try other options, and settled on this classic model from Sony.Status\u2019s HD Two and these Sony MDR7506 headphones are in the same price range, and I can hear this. I would say they sound almost identical. I don\u2019t have *too* much experience with audio equipment, so I won\u2019t attempt to use audiophile terminology and embarrass myself.For everyday entertainment use, these are almost the perfect pair of headphones in my opinion. The sound signature is exactly what I want it to be.I am not a huge fan of the design, although I find nothing about it to be a dealbreaker. The cable could have been detachable. I am also not a huge fan of the curly cable. While I can see its usefulness to many people, I just think it looks unsightly and sometimes gets in the way. I don\u2019t use these on the go at all (only at my work desk), but doing so feels a bit cumbersome because of the cable. The curly wire is heavier than a regular, straight cable, and therefore unwieldy. I really wish that I had the option to swap them out for something more subdued.The rest of the (retro feeling) design is not bad at all. The actual headphones do look much better than what you can see in the low quality product image at the time of this writing. To get a better idea, look up video reviews of this product on YouTube.These headphones are very comfortable to wear, once you adjust the cups properly for your head size (this is *very* important, or you may experience ear ache after a few minutes of use). The whole thing is extremely bendable, twistable and collapsible. This isn't always a great thing, because it feels a bit flimsy at times. But hey, I have used this pair for over two months and nothing has broken so far. The ear cups may be slightly smaller than the ones on Status's HD Two, but they are squishy and comfortable in their own way. The clamping force on the Sony pair is significantly lighter as well, which I really like.The packaging was notably nice; the headphones were cradled in a box covered in a satin-like fabric. I was also surprised to see Sony include schematics of the hardware for repair guidance. The pamphlet even has retro-ish typography on it. While I would have preferred a hard case, the included leather carry bag is appreciated.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R242ZMMWCOEK5G?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Awesome sound!", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2014-01-03", "review_body": "I'm using these with my little behringer USB guitar adapter and guitar rig software.

The closed-back design helps minimize bleed, and they fold-up very small for use on the road.However, the ear-pads are simply a deal-breaker.  The foam is covered with a super-thin rubbery plastic that frays and tears way too easily.  Also, the only way that this plastic membrane is \"attached\" to the can is by sliding it in-between two plastic layers, so it can easily slip out of the groove, forcing you to spend quite a bit of time carefully working it back into place (carefully because it is so thin that it will easily tear if you do not do it surgically).  I have to do this about twice per week, so even though the sound on these is good, I look forward to the day when I will eventually get a more well-designed headphone.If you only review these on the sound, then they are great.  But if you care about usability, I would look for a headphone with a sturdy fabric or vinyl ear-cover (similar to my Beyerdynamic DT-880 Pro's--incredible sounding headphone, and the ear-pads will last forever).", "review_rating": 2, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMNG3TRQVGGW5?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Comfort and sound hate earbuds", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2019-01-25", "review_body": "Compact with carry bag, puts me in a world I enjoy being in", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT4D45271TOUQ?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Does a great job.

They fold up which is nice and makes for easy storage and overall protection but it looks like that feature might be a weak spot because the hinge is so tiny and dainty looking. The cord is amazing. Very thick wire and it's coiled so there's little chance of a tangley mess. Also the plug comes with the adapter which is actually threaded and screws on, which is a very nice feature. That should ensure longevity in the contact. Also as you can see in the pic there is a small external wire that runs along the side which also looks like it could break easily if not careful. They are very comfortable and fit nicely. They cancel the noise pretty well from the outside but are certainly not quiet headphones to those who may be around you if you're listening to music really loud, others will definitely know. Overall pretty solid specs so that earned it 4 stars. However, In my opinion the overall sound quality wasn't what I was expecting. They sound kind of flat and dull like the eq isn't set right or something. It sounds the same on every device I use it on, just kind of good, not great.

IF you have a good soundcard, or an amp, and have a properly mixed cd, you can hit an amazing sweet spot.  just don't think these are right for casual listening.  anyway my 1 cents worth on this update.....i am writing this review from the perspective of someone who is NOT an 'audiophile,' an 'elitist,' nor someone who pretends to hear things they don't, just a moderately interested listener with a bare minimum of mixing experience ( digidesign )....regarding these headphones sound, well, i can pretty much suggest the following 3 issues, provided you have any hearing whatsoever....1.  you WILL learn to use the EQ settings on your equipment, you will be forced to, or you WILL have ear and brain fatigue before long2.  you will need to have a pretty good 'source' and equipment both, to enjoy these phones, they will make poorly encoded flac and mp3 files sound VERY bad, in other words, they will EASILY show you how bad ( or good ) the encoding was3.  you will need to allow, i would say, 20 or 30 hours of burn in to get them to open up....just my opinion, not worth much i suppose, but goodness, these things are NOT meant for just passive listening....you just about canNOT passively listen to these...are they clear?  yes.  do they represent the recording? yes.  is the bass controlled? yes.  is the bass 'boomy?'  NO THANK GOODNESS.However, there is not any 'polishing' of the music, and unless you EQ each disc, in conjunction with your equipment, i don't think you will enjoy long listening periods with these.  You will soon hear things that will drive you crazy.  They are AWESOME for teaching your ears to discern different mixes, frequencies and flavors of the disc, but it will soon wear you out.  GREAT for reference, for mixing, for analysis, not very enjoyable at all for relaxed listening.

I've started using it out of the box and it has been a couple of months now. So I guess this review will be based on full capability of the headphone.Pros:+ Very good wide sound stage as described by wirecutter. Although some may feel it artificial.+ Extremely sensitive to input driving levels. Probably the best Headphone with a Good Equalizer. You can sense every single change you make!+ Good Balance of Lows and Highs and Amplified Mids. Does the Job great for recording purposes.+ Distortion free sound even if the volume is maxed out.+ Good Quality plastic. Feels like 80's though. Reliable.Cons:- Ear piercing treble, I mean almost painful for long listening at High volume. I guess these headphones are used in studios for a reason. It is good for recording purposes, but for regular listening I would be happy with probably toned down treble.- Bass is Ok. It is punchy at High volume but if you incline towards bass heavy, too bad you need an EQ or chose another.- Cheap quality ear pads.Overall I am satisfied with the product.If you would like to strap your headphones almost entire day and have a sound that is both clear and pleasant to the ear, I guess the Audio Technica M50s is better. You can do the same with this but with EQ tuning and Beyerdynamic's earpads.Thank you!", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJJFQBG5OJZBV?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Great headphone.", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2015-04-20", "review_body": "These are great headphones, a standard in TV and film production for years.

I was surprised to hear how much more sound I could hear with these. In short, they're almost perfect.The only problem I encounter is with the bass response. They are very \"flat\" in their output, meaning the bass isn't amped up the way it is on Bose or Beats headphones. This is fine when you're in a quiet listening environment, as the clarity of these phones allows you to enjoy all aspects of sound, including the bass. However, if you're listening on a bus, the low rumble of the engine will drown out the bass, which can be pretty disappointing.

My older set is still working fine after 7+ years of use -it only needed replacement of the nylon covers on the still-comfortable ear pads at about 4.5 years. I think I paid about $6-7 for a pair of covers here at Amazon. I've tried a few under-$200 headphones and have not found anything to compare to the 7506s in terms of both flat-true sound reproduction, comfort, and compactness. On the latter, I am submitting a photo that compares the sizes of the 7506 to a pair of the also-excellent Audio-Technica M-50. I got a bad sample of the M50, but I would have tried a second pair if not for their size. I think the compactness of these 7506s is an under-rated feature.My new 7506s are as good as my prior set, although they're a little more base-enhanced, and the coiled cord stretches about 10 feet max, which is couple of feet less that my older pair. Each of these features may be preferred by some, and it is possible that each difference is attributable to age, I especially appreciate that the new phones are as comfortable, and that their build quality is as good as ever.If anyone can recommed a pair that may be a step up to these fine phones, in either an open or closed design, in the under-$200-at-Amazon category, and that is equally compact or nearly-so, please add a comment to this review. Thank you. Enjoy the music regardeless of how you reproduce it.EDIT/UPDATE: As for build quality, the nylon cover on the right ear pad began to come undone at about 7 months. On my original 7506s, the pads lasted about 5 years. I am posting a photo to illustrate the problem with my 8-month-old headphones.

But my son had an earlier pair that were meant for children and that item's sound reproduction was lacking, even by his assessment.  I have had my fingers crossed since I gave him the Sony MDR7506 headphones, but in nearly four months, including three plane trips and regular storage in their bag inside his duffel (between homes of his divorced parents), they have held up flawlessly.  They do sound incredible and he loves their fit (and I do, as well, on my seriously bigger head).  And I did buy the extended warranty, just in case.

I just ordered this pair for a buddy of mine who I convinced (quite easily, once he heard them) to get a pair for himself.  The sound quality is on par with other studio headphones many times the cost, and will blow most \"audiophile\" consumer headphones out of the water.  They're snug on the head but not tight and the pads fit very nicely over the ear, offering a decent amount of isolation.  The coiled cable stays out of the way when you need it to, and the threaded 1/8\" to 1/4\" adapter that comes with it ensures a solid connection if you need to use it.

I was going to keep them to see if they grew on me but unfortunately the right side started buzzing at certain frequencies so I chose to return them. I looked around for a pair of headphones that would be more suitable for music and movies and ended up buying a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO's and I was blown away! They're very pleasant sounding, the bass is nice and not over bearing, and they're VERY comfortable. If you're willing to spend about $50 more or so (I got mine new for $130, hold out for a deal!) then I really recommend the DT 770's as an alternative choice to these Sony's. If that's a little out of your price range I have friends who swear by the Grado SR80i, which go for about $99.

The Sony's have more comfortable and better fitting earpads, a longer and replaceable cable, and the materials and construction seem sturdier than the Grados. One potential shortcoming of the Sony's (that doesn't really affect me) is that they probably aren't a good choice for mobile use.  They are pretty bulky and the cable is long. But for high-fidelity home listening, at under $100, I can't imagine how you could do better.

The audio response is very well balanced: no piercing highs, no enveloping mids, no muddy/overpowering bass. Every single nuance is represented with pristine clarity, and when people say that you'll hear everything with these headphones, they mean it.To the people worrying about the absence of bass due to these being studio-monitoring headsets, the bass is, without a doubt, there in full presence. If you're used to hearing muddy sounding bass or music drenched in low-end sloppiness, you'll be surprised to hear how warm and how articulately the MDR-7506 reproduces bass, yet still managing to hit the listener with such a convincing punch.The high end is of course a pleasure to listen to. The high notes are crystal clear and do not show any signs of being artificially stressed or represented, giving a very silky smooth sound.As for the midrange? One fear of buying headphones is that you end up with hollow sounding music due to the lack of a solid defined midrange, but the midrange is one more thing to compliment about the 7506's. From prominent male vocals to snares, nothing ever seems overpowered, and yet it manages to fill the space with a full rich sound.Overall, the combination in sound from all the spectrums produces a very unbiased enjoyable harmony to the ears. As I listen to all types of music genres, from ballads to rock, classic to RnB, and pop to techno, I have yet to find a genre that these heaphones fail to reproduce with exceptional fidelity.And did I mention these headphones are very comfortable? I've worn these close to half a day without my ears being fatigued. Many earbuds and headphones have the tendency to make ears hurt/sore after only a short session of listening. I would say I have bigger than normal sized ears and the large-diaphragm design, combined with the very soft leather-wrapped earpads, really helps in making the circumural design (wrapped around the ears as opposed to on top) work well. This also means that sound is sealed off very well, muffling sounds from the outside coming in, and from the music inside getting out. For example, these are the type of headphones you would want to carry with you to public places (bus rides, airplane trips) instead of headphones like the Sennheiser HD595's.Having had these headphones for 1-2 years already, the quality is still as good as when I got them, and I don't doubt that they will be any different for a long long while.Ultimately, with the price tag being conveniently under 100 USD, this is an excellent buy. Even in comparison with higher end headphones, the sound quality for the MDR-7506 is still ranked as the top in my charts, as well as many other people's. If you look closely at professional settings around the world (i.e. studio performances, behind-the-scenes movie sets, &amp; radio stations), as I have started to notice recently, you will see this exact model appear time and time again for a very good reason.Cons:The only con I would like to point out is that the earpads do tend to wear out after prolonged use. Since they are very soft to the skin and thus are made from very fine material, they are subject to wear &amp; tear. Though, replacement earpads are cheap, easy to find, and easy to install. In total, i've only had to replace the earpads once since I got the 7506's, and that's with the headphones going through daily abuse.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCUW4K6EA9DW6?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Clear sound", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2015-01-25", "review_body": "Best sounding headphones I've ever had.

The Sony MDR7506 fits the bill on all counts. The only weak link appears to be the earpads as many have pointed out. The good news is replacement pads are readily available, which is something you can\u2019t say for several other headphones currently on the market.The sound quality on these is really good whether I\u2019m listening to music on my iPod, computer or watching TV thru my amp. And unlike several other headphones I\u2019ve used recently, these ones don\u2019t make my head feel like its been in a vice after only a short period of time wearing them. And although they fold up nicely and come with a travel bag, I bought these specifically for listening around the house. So if you\u2019re in the market for portable headphones, you might want to look elsewhere due to the long coiled cord.Overall I\u2019d highly recommend the MDR7506 to anyone looking for great set of studio monitor headphones at a very reasonable price.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IFI6XL4D1QTZ?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Five Stars", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2015-02-22", "review_body": "terrific product", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C171E6HUP9GY?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Five Stars", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2018-03-11", "review_body": "good!!", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YFPGDFQRX219?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "They sound great and easily compare with some $300 Bose headphones that ...", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2014-08-15", "review_body": "They sound great and easily compare with some $300 Bose headphones that I had.

I know I like how the Sony's fit me better.  I truly don't think you will be disappointed in the MDR-7506 headphones.  The knock on Sony headsets is usually the earpads.

I found out about this product because I was searching for good studio headphones that were a good price. The reason why I wanted to purchase these was because I needed Industry standard headphones for music production. These headphones are ideal for sound monitoring in recording studios, radio, film production, video, and electronic news gatherings. Sony 7500 Series headphones offer a practical range of choices for everyone from the casual user to the studio pro. The headphone type is Dynamic, Closed. The cord length is  9.8 feet. These headphones are also ranked #24 in Musical Instruments.  The reason why these headphones are appealing to people is because they're cheap, have great sound, and comfortable. Usually Industry standard headphones like these are very expensive ranging from 200 to 1000 dollars. This product only costs 90 dollars. This was probably why the Sony MDR7506 headphones are so popular in the music industry and also media industry due to their unbelievable pricing. Another reason why these are so popular is because of the sound. In my opinion the sound frequencies that these headphones deliver are excellent. Compared to consumer headphones such as Beats and Apple headphones, these overkill them. It brings out the clarity and bass from songs. When it comes to buying headphones, comfortability plays a big role for your choice. The ear pads are really comfortable and easy to adapt to various ear sizes.  The main weaknesses of this product is that their sound isn\u2019t the best until you use a amplifier, the cord is too long, and it\u2019s not detachable. Connecting these headphones straight to a computer is okay, but if you can connect it to an amplifier, you can increase the bass and clarity of an audio piece. I haven\u2019t purchased a amplifier yet so I don\u2019t know what these headphones sound like at their full potential. Having a cord that's too long can be a hassle. Usually people use these headphones up close to their computer so you wouldn\u2019t really need a long cord. It sometimes gets annoying.  Overall, these headphones too me are still good. You still receive excellent quality from a headphone that\u2019s very cheap compared to others. Even though it has it\u2019s struggles, the grad i give these is an A. The reason why is because of it\u2019s very good build quality, decent midrange performance, and it\u2019s excel performance at live sound monitoring. I think if any consumer buys these, they would not regret it because these headphones deliver so much at a low price.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N6NKQ67M30V1?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Nice purchase", "review_helpful_votes": 1, "review_date": "2013-11-23", "review_body": "This product is amazing.It's quality is supreme but with a such low price.the outlook is a little bit outdated", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26EB4ZL7PHMQ5?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "too heavy", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2017-11-03", "review_body": "just a little too heavy", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38C2DSXTV31X4?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Best Value", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2013-01-26", "review_body": "I have owned these for 5 years.

You could crank up the volume to no end on the MDR-V600 and they would sound great. The more you crank up the MDR7506 the tinnier sounding they get. If you're into hard rock or heavy metal and like your music loud don't buy these. I was very disappointed.

They used to output a balanced sound throughout the frequency spectrum. I say used to, because they don't anymore. My new pair is definitely bass tinted, like zillion of other headphones on the market. Why did Sony do this? Are they using cheap chinese components to save money? Are they trying to reposition this product on the market to reach the bass freak people, which is about 80% of music listeners? I think it is a bad decision for 2 reasons. First, they are going to lose the studio market. Second, you can find lots of cheaper and more confortable bass tinted headphones out there.

All the reviews I read were said they were great and even a friend at a music store said they were the best on the market.Got them today and the first test was listening to some music on my stereo.  They sounded very good and may have been worth the price right there.  Recording was very good with them, all the instruments came out sounding clear.  The deal breaker was when I plugged them into my amp; they produced a horrible feedback that was simply too much to get past.  When I plugged in my old headphone kit (a 5$ pair of Panasonics with a 2$ jack adapter) I noticed that there was NO FEED BACK AT ALL.  Sure the tones did not come out as rich as on the Sony's but that didn't matter when the rich tone was covered up by a great deal of feedback and buzzing.At that point, I immediately decided to send the back for a refund.

See the originally posted version at the bottom for details.If you're looking at this review, it means you're probably looking for high quality neutral sounding headphones  If you're looking for overemphasized bass, there's always Beats by Dre.  But if you want/need to hear the music as it was originally recorded/mixed then these are the phones you want.  These are very neutral headphones designed for hearing the any flaws in the signal.There's a reason that these are #1 on the DJ Headphones list.For reference, when you add these headphones to your cart Amazon will recommend a 8 inch headphone case.  This case is very roomy and fits the headphones fine.  However, these headphones are collapsible.  I chose a case designed for collapsible phones (the SLAPPA SL-HP-01).  It's significantly more compact and is the minimum size to hold these headphones.  I did a review of it separately.These headphones have an impedance of 63 ohms, which can make them a difficult load for some portable devices.  I purchased the FiiO E06 Fujiyama headphone amplifier which is about the size of a book of matches.  It's currently rated #1 on the Headphone Amplifier list.  Again, I reviewed it separately.As expected, these headphones are great.  The sound quality is excellent, with smooth response and good clean sound. Very highly recommended if you want neutral sound.Original review of initially received pair:This is a temporary review, while I am waiting for a replacement headphone from Amazon.I've had a pair of MDR V6 headphones since 1987, and they've been awesome.  However, years of use on board submarines have taken a toll.  I recently replaced the cushions, but the headband was going to cost almost as much as a new pair.  While looking for a new pair, I found the MDR7506 was on sale for the same price so I ordered them.  While researching, I discovered that these headphones are commonly counterfeit.  I watched some unboxing videos on Youtube which showed what to look for and expect when receiving a new pair of MDR V6 or MDR7506.I received the headphones today.  While unboxing, I was saddened to find that the headphones had been previously used.  The cable should have been in a clear plastic bag with yellow tape closure.  Instead the cord was stretched and kinked in several placed, and was unbagged.  The black pouch, which should have been folded in quarters, was laying flat in the bottom of the box.  The pouch still has crease marks from being previously folded.  On the back of the right earcup, there's a dried residue of what looks like sweat or some other liquid.  The warranty card is missing.In short, someone opened these, used them for a while, and then put them back into the box. If the cable were unkinked, I'd probably just keep these.  Since I want (and paid for) a pristine pair, I notified Amazon for an exchange.  The replacement pair should arrive tomorrow. I will update this review based on the replacement pair.  It'll probably be a 5 star, since I really like the sound of this series of headphones.", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NMX0OIC4FC6N?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Excellent headphones", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2009-12-25", "review_body": "My Christmas gift to myself great with my I-Pod, professional sound quality, a bit snug but comfortable fit", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29LTPBPMVOKDI?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Studio Monitor not for Bass Head", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2014-10-06", "review_body": "Lacking a little on bass, but the bass is extremely tight.

Actually, I don't NEED them as this original pair is still kicking! However, I tried the MDR-V6 and a new MDR7506 and according to my ears there IS a difference. A BIG difference to me. Mostly to me mid-range frequencies are not nearly as clear, they are too muddy.You can't go wrong paying an extra $20 - $30 for the MDR7506.Of course, this is my opinion.

I was very disappointed to see that these didn't include the Vinyl Pouch, that's one thing I've come to expect upon opening up a new pair of MDRs.", "review_rating": 4, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DMTR25I4PQ49?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Had them for more than 2 months", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2013-04-29", "review_body": "And they've only performed better &amp; better.

I've tested them, comparing their sound to each other and to my sources.The V150 are the cheapest (reg $50 CDN, sale $30) and they feel (in construction and materials and comfort) and sound cheap when compared to the other two. I bought these first and they were fine for a singer or drummer recording parts, although not inspiring. I was happy for the money I spent and was wondering if more expensive headphones were worth it. The V150's sound and isolation isn't good enough to give keyboardists, guitarists, bassists an accurate representation of their parts.I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones and began researching on-line. The M40x's (reg $180 CDN, sale $150), along with their sibling M50x get excellent ratings. I bought the M40x on sale and was pleasantly surprised at the huge improvement from the V150's... WOW!!!  So there IS indeed better headphone sound at a higher price.However, since I bought the M40x's I've not seen them on sale and their price has increased a lot. I wanted to get 3 more headphones with such good sound but can't afford the M40x's. More research led me to discover excellent ratings for the SONY MDR 7506 ($140 CDN). SONY has been making these for decades, so they're tried and true and it's easy to find replacement parts. When I read numerous times how the 7506's are often used by professionals in the recording world, I thought they'd be perfect.The M40x's come closest to what I hear from my sources. The 7506's are very bright, with the highs being very forward, the bottom restrained and the sub-frequencies lacking. It's a very noticeable difference between the two headphones, like listening to FM radio (the M40x's) and then AM radio (the 7506's). This is odd because the 7506 claim to have a frequency range of 10-20kHz while the M40x's have 15-24kHz, and yet we hear more bass from the M40's and more highs from the 7506's. So, sonically, these are very different and some people prefer one over the other. They both sound good, and you'll quickly adjust or get used to the sound until you compare it to the other.The SONY headphones have attached cords, the V150 has a straight cord and the 7506 has a coiled cable. The M40x has detachable cables which can be locked/unlocked, so you can replace or change your cables, which is a bonus and potentially means the headphones will last much longer. I should say that I read many reviews of people claiming their 7506 headphones lasted them 10+ years without hassle. There is more padding for the ears and head on the M40x's, so it fits more snugly and is a bit heavier and feels a bit more solid too. Both headphones can collapse to be more portable. Both come with a cloth carrying case.Ultimately, if you get a chance to hear the 7506 and M40x to compare them, do so. They're both good headphones at a reasonable price that I would recommend. I don't think the Dre's compare in sound for the price, and I also think the Sennheiser HD280 sounds too boxy in comparison.", "review_rating": 3, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19IB0W4R98BR2?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "very good", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2015-08-30", "review_body": "the sounds very well", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5V74KO039TYG?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "price": 79.99, "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"}, {"review_title": "Quality sound for a fair price.", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2014-02-05", "review_body": "Great sound quality, very comfortable, and it really helps you immerse yourself in the music.

For $100 I expected a better sound profile and with all these amazing reviews I am left wondering if people cannot hear it or are accustomed to poor sound. I by far prefer my $20 ear buds over these headphones but of course they are both working with different dynamics. If your only use for these is listening to music casually go get some decent ear buds. Ear buds are small, light, harder to break, and cheaper to replace as well as often times more comfortable. I am regretting my purchase currently as it isnt so easy to listen to all your favorite music when it hurts your ears. I trusted the Sony name and all the reviews and have found myself disappointed. Do yourself a favor and do some research if you want to use these for production or every day listening.That being said they are comfortable at least and they have a nice low end which is important to me but still doesn't outweigh their major flaw.Here is an absolutely great review of these headphones from a company that deals with high end audio for a living and you can see the frequency spike on the high end.[...]", "review_rating": 2, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YT8UQZHYGLYE?ASIN=B000AJIF4E", "article": "Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone", "price": 79.99}, {"review_title": "Quite Good", "review_helpful_votes": 0, "review_date": "2014-03-16", "review_body": "Bought these to replace my Grado SR80 which fell apart.

The carrying case is an absurdly cheap vinyl/leatherette pouch that's barely big enough and looks like crap, so I tossed it in a drawer right away.  The compact/folding design and overall look isn't bad, but it certainly isn't a tenth as impressive as my friend's Beats headphones (admittedly, the Beats are much more expensive).  The big bold print on the top of the crosspiece is tacky looking.  I immediately used them on two cross-country trips (4 long flights in all), and the experience was very disappointing.  The comfort and feel is okay, but nothing special.  My biggest complaint is that the sound is \"shallow\" with these headphones.  I have to crank the volume all the way to 10 on my iPad in order to hear music or movies at a reasonable level.  My previous Sony headphones (which were cheaper) had excellent bass, midrange, and treble, and the overall volume was outstanding, not shallow at all.
