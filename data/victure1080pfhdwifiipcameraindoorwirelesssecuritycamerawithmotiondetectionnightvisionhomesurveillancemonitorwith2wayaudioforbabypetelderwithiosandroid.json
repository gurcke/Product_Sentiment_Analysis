I have a wonderful 4 year old MaltiPoo named BEAR. My wife and son have spent the summer with family in Lake Tahoe so it has just been my dog and me roughing it at home. I bought the Victure 1080P on Amazon Prime day because it was a great deal and I wanted to be able to see what Bear did all day by himself while I am at work.  During the school year my wife is at home with him every day so he is never alone.Since Bear is pretty much everyone's favorite \"family member\" I also wanted my wife and son to be able to check in on him from their phones too.I've worked with many security cameras over the years and my hobby since I was a teen has been video and video editing, so believe me when I tell you that this Pan &amp; Tilt Wireless Security Camera records the best images and video I have seen for this class of camera.  The images are sharp, bright and colorful!The  Pan and Tilt mechanics are nothing short of amazing.  The camera responds extremely fast moving from one set angle to the next.  It really is impressive how quickly it pans/tilts.I really liked the fact that it automaps a 360 degree panoramic photo so you can quickly move the camera to record an exact scene.One day I wanted to be alerted when a package came so I put it on the kitchen window sill and had it record the entrance area through the window.  The image was crystal clear and I was alerted the moment the delivery person opened our gate.On the one hand both my wife and son were able to connect to the camera with very little help from me since they are 500 miles away relaxing on the beach while I toil in the salt mines (I'm not bitter that they're enjoying a 6 week vacation..not a bit)  but on the other hand my wife says she can't bear to watch our Bear because it makes her sad that all he does is wait by the door for me someone to come home.So now as a result of getting this truly amazing camera at a great deal  I now have to pay someone to go by my house twice a day to play with Bear until my family comes home from their extended vacation.You can't go wrong if you purchase the Victure 1080P FHD WiFi IP Camera, you will be amazed at the build quality, features and recorded images and video quality that it produces.I almost forgot to mention the customer service is outstanding!  I could not have been more impressed with my interactions with Rebecca.", "article": "Victure 1080P FHD WiFi IP Camera Indoor Wireless Security Camera with Motion Detection Night Vision Home Surveillance Monitor with 2-Way Audio for Baby/Pet/Elder with iOS/Android", "review_helpful_votes": 53}, {"review_date": "2018-08-27", "review_rating": 1, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UHSV7UJE8H0I?ASIN=B07BVSXZ8F", "price": 45.99, "review_title": "UPDATE: Connection Failed - TERRIBLE wireless.", "review_body": "Overall I like the easy of use this camera offers. It is not difficult to setup and is quite easily controlled through your phone. The picture quality is pretty decent--though I wish the camera had wider angles on both axis. I also love the ability to talk to the camera side of things through my phone. For the price of this camera, it's a good buy with only one real negative that ALMOST renders this camera useless in some situations, and definitely limits your options for placement--the wireless connection and the ability to watch the stream in real time. It is absolutely garbage. If the camera is within the line of sight of your router, it's a decent connection with near real-time, uninterrupted video. Put a single wall or the floor between the camera and router... forget about using the wireless connection. The signal strength emitted by the camera is downright disappointing. I know it's the camera's antenna because I have upgraded antenna's on my router. Without hardwiring the camera or placing it in the same room as your router, the ability to remote into the camera to view live feed is nearly nonexistent. When a connection is actually established through the app, the bitrate is so slow that it takes tens of seconds to send or receive commands (Camera movement), and the video is delayed, intermittent, and cuts out constantly. For the price, a good camera. I would hardly classify it as a wireless though.UPDATE 11/5/18: Downgraded from a generous 4 stars (rounded up from 3.5) to a 1 star. Like I mentioned in my earlier review, this camera had absolutely terrible wireless reception. I have a reputable, nice router with upgraded antennas and the wireless just connected at best. Fast forward to today, the camera won't connect wirelessly at all anymore. I tried to reset and reprogram the camera via the APP and it  does nothing.Also, I emailed the company about the PC software they offered in response to another customer's question, and I never got a response. Very disappointed in this camera. I bought it for it's wireless function and instead it's now an ugly paperweight.

The only person that had granted access to the camera was on my phone. This camera was set up in my bedroom and only paired to my own personal cellphone.  Before I go to bed I set the camera to view the wall so that it isn't in view of the room. At night I could hear the camera moving and adjusting so that it could get a view of where it was. The camera did not do one full rotation as if it were reseting itself, it rotated to one side then attempted to rotate some more to look around. Luckily for me I placed tape over the infrared lights the day I purchased it so that I wouldn't see the lights at night.

The first one worked perfectly, before it fell from height (my fault for not attaching it securely). I emailed the seller and they sent a replacement, which I believe is an updated version of the previous one. The updated one (even though they are both version PC530) has subscription for cloud storage! Wow! And guess what, the first month is free for all to try! This was on one of my wish list and Victure worked on providing it affordably for all too. There is also a slot for a micro SD card if you want to save the videos without subscription but at $8 per annual, it's really affordable. What I really like is the two way communication that one can use (I can totally communicate with the other person/my bunny on the other side) Needless to say, other than being able to view clearly during the day, there's also the night mode and it's really clear. That's pretty amazing to know how well the night mode works. I'm able to see my bunny play in the middle of the night and it confirms the fact that bunnies sleep all day and party all night.That aside, communication with the seller is also another drawing point for us, the seller is super quick in their response. Setting up is also a breeze. I used back the same app and all I did was to plug in the new camera and it automatically hooked on to the app that I used for the previous camera. How great is that! If you have problems setting up, I would guess that you might have done something wrong somewhere, cause it's really easy to set this up.So much use for this camera that we actually bought another one already. :)", "article": "Victure 1080P FHD WiFi IP Camera Indoor Wireless Security Camera with Motion Detection Night Vision Home Surveillance Monitor with 2-Way Audio for Baby/Pet/Elder with iOS/Android", "review_helpful_votes": 9}, {"review_date": "2018-11-07", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HZ182WE5H9DO?ASIN=B07BVSXZ8F", "price": 45.99, "review_title": "Detailed Good Review", "review_body": "So this device looks exactly as in product pictures. This camera is not that big and fits in most places. I originally bought this camera to watch over my dog when I am not home and I have to say that this camera definitely exceeded my expectations. So the quality of the camera is a 4 out of 5, the picture looks better when it switches over to the night view compared to the normal day view but either way quality is good. The mobility of it is 360 degrees even though you do eventually hit a turning max in both directions; looks directly up but when it comes to looking down it is limited but manageable. The setup literally took me 2 minutes, so wicked easy. The app is OK, not the best but very easy to use and configure settings. Able to share the camera feed between multiple accounts and devices. The only con about this device I would have to say would be, in order to record on a extended period of time you have to stay in the app BUT it does record videos of when it detects motion and saves it via a micro SD or cloud storage. So I would recommended purchasing a micro SD so you don't have to pay monthly for cloud storage. Also with the motion detection it does alert your phone via notification from the app. You can also take photos, videos and even allows you to talk through the camera from the app. So as for a inside the house camera (definitely not made for outdoors) it is the best I have found. I was able to get a deal on this camera but I would pay up to $80 for this camera because it is that good, definitely worth the buy.", "article": "Victure 1080P FHD WiFi IP Camera Indoor Wireless Security Camera with Motion Detection Night Vision Home Surveillance Monitor with 2-Way Audio for Baby/Pet/Elder with iOS/Android", "review_helpful_votes": 9}], [{"review_date": "2018-07-18", "review_rating": 5, "review_source": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R153Z2ONZ72DWP?ASIN=B07BVSXZ8F", "price": 45.99, "review_title": "Surprisingly Easy To Set Up", "review_body": "This is a winner. While the instruction book is fairly hard to follow (they offer many \"Warm Tip\" instead of \"Hot Tip\"), the only thing you need to do is download the app to your phone. Once your phone and the camera are in the same wifi network and once you tell the app the wifi password, the app will do all of the setup. One brilliant step... the phone app starts making some noises that apparently instructs the camera to try connecting to wifi. Based on the manual, I was expecting a hassle, but in five minutes the device was working.Once it is set up, your phone can monitor the camera from anywhere. I have it along one wall of a 1200 square foot condo and can pan to monitor the whole room.

It is however unfortunate that the design isn\u2019t really conducive to being mounted because the lens doesn\u2019t move up as far as it should to see the room. That is a design flaw that needs to be repaired, hence the deduction of a star. I would have prefer it be mounted and that fact that I couldn\u2019t actually see the picture is very disappointing. But the overall image is good and while there is a delay in the visuals I do like how seamless it is to operate. I also deducted a star for the motion detection because you can\u2019t use it without an SD card and that\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019ve purchased other cameras, far less in quality than this one and wasn\u2019t notified of motion detection.

If you're watching people you know or animals, it's should be perfect. A year ago I got my mother a kitten. 2 months ago I got her another one. She was like a little kid, again and didn't want to leave these kittens to go to work so I got her this camera and now she can check in, watch, show her friends the cats whenever she likes. It rotates and swivels and she can find the kittens where ever they are in the house and she can watch them play. If theyre not around, she can call them through the camera (mic/speaker) and they come running. It's a blast. At first it would crack her up watching them try to figure out where the voice was coming from. Now they just meow back. It's easy to hook up. It swivels and pivots and zooms. It's easy to use. In fact, all her friends with cats loved it so I came back and bought additional units (not on sale) to give to them so they can all watch their cats together. I'll try to post a little video so you can see the quality. But if you want to just keep an eye on a per while away (or see who's home, When) this us great for that. You can record with the push of a button. Although I haven't had much luck with the notion activation (not that I've tried). She uses this daily. Multiple times a day.

Unreliable iPhone app. Motion detect is erratic. Ended up hating it!", "review_body": "All I want is a WiFi camera with motion detection to sit inside front window to watch the porch. FAIL. Regardless of the \"sensibility\" setting 0-5, it detects and alerts the tiniest movement (from cars on the distant road with lights on or reflections, or reflections off of the window). Yet, drive an SUV 15' away right in front of the camera in plain view - and nothing. Someone can walk up the driveway, be entirely in view of the camera from the driveway, walk onto the porch, place a package . . . and it MIGHT trigger when they're about 3' away, saving a nice short video of their waist, and them walking away. So unreliable it's useless. Besides, scrolling back through video (I record always) is grueling in the app, making that nearly useless also.Connectivity trying to review triggered events is hit-and-miss. The camera and iPhone are 10' away from WiFi router, yet often this stupid camera finds, then fails to playback the video snippet - so after a short time, just reverts to showing the current view (without notice). Try again and it might playback.Bottom line is it's unreliable enough to be aggravating - saving and alerting useless events, and missing blatant needed events. What WERE they thinking designing this thing?There is NO motion zones to set - it's all or nothing. My very old D-link camera allowed setting motion detect zones as a grid across the camera's field of view - and NEVER falsed nor missed. Too bad it's too old now to be viable.

Not knowing much about surveillance cameras , I bought this one mainly due to the price and saw that it had good reviews. The camera, however, is difficult to set up. Difficult but not impossible, patience is a must here. The manual that comes with the camera is sketchy at best. There's a QR tag on the first page to install the app on your phone but it might not work if your phone doesn't allow downloads from unknown sources. I downloaded the app from Google Play and it worked fine. Watch every tutorial you can and read every review. Make sure you buy a micro disk for this camera, regular disks will be too large. Also, make sure that when you install the disk that you put it in upside down (with prongs facing up) or you won't be able to get it into the camera. You will have to push the disk into the slot with your fingernail until it disappears. Be sure to have the camera unplugged when you install the disk or it won't be detected by the camera. Once you work out the bugs though, it's pretty good and has a decent picture. The video loops every 24 hours starting at 12 midnight. Playback does seem to skip at points and camera will go offline if you're in a location with a poor connection.

The directions for this camera are not that clear. It took me 2 days with the help of a tech friend to figure out how to change my wifi in order to set up the device. Once I set it up and figured out the basics, I put the micro sd card in. I can watch the dogs, hear them and speak to them at any time of the day now which is great. I can even control the angle of view and move the camera around almost 360 degrees right from my phone. That part is great and the images are pretty good. I think I can even up the image quality to HD but I havent done that yet since I figured it would use all the memory on the sd card. The problem I'm having now is going back to view previously recorded footage. I cant figure out how to view the recordings from the sd card to my phone. I think I might need to actually take the sd card out and put it into my comp to view past footage but that wouldnt make sense. I have to research that further... The next good part is that it includes 30 days of cloud usage and records 7 days straight for the free 30 day usage. So I switched to the cloud use for now... Then I go into the app and it let's me view anything already recorded. This works fine but I wasnt planning on paying another monthly fee when I bought this camera. So I'll have to figure out what I'm going to do at the end of the 30 days. ???? As far as the quality of the camera, it rotates silently so the dogs dont even realize that it's there. The sound quality is just ok and sometimes theres distortion or feedback in the sound on both ends (camera and phone). There is only a fraction of a second delay in the video which is pretty impressive. It also has an alert setting for motion so that I can be alerted if someone enters the house or if the dogs are active. There are many good features. It does NOT track motion on it's own.

I read reviews and watched pricing carefully.  Prices have dropped and the quality of the cameras have gone up considerably.  I wanted a few cameras to be able to check on the house when we were out of town, check on the pets, etc.  I already had the Ring system on the exterior of the house.  I have the doorbell on the front, and an extra on the back.  I think Ring is over priced for what you get and will not purchase another Ring camera.The Victure however, is a much better camera and an amazing interior system for the following reasons.1. Ease of installation.  It installed within a couple of minutes  by following the directions.2.  The cost was significantly lower than others.  I purchased on Black Friday and was so impressed I purchased another in February.  I'm going to by a third one this month.3.  The quality of picture.  1080P.  It's better than my eyesight so I can't complain.4.  Phone App.  I can check in and talk to my wife when I'm at work.5.  Customer support.  They keep asking me if I need help, but it installed without any problems so it's nice to know the are concerned.6.  I can use a micro SD card on each camera for under 10 bucks instead of cloud service which is an option if you want it.  I like that Victure offered cloud service, but wasn't pushy, unlike Ring.I have no problem recommending the Victure.

For us, to put it in the small table next to the entrance door is great. Then, the set up is easy. As long as you follow the instruction, you should be able to finish the setup in 5 minutes. After all is done, you can use the APP to control the direction where the camera should look at. Or just ask the camera to do a 360 angle picture taking. The picture and video quality is good enough for a small camera like this. What is great is the camera can detect movements at night and alarm your cell phone so you know you dog wakes up and walking around. My wife is glad that I bought this.

The video camera has to be on when you are using it. If you prefer to receive just the sounds and occasionally check the video there is no such feature.The reason for this feature to be so important is that keeping the video on drains the battery of your phone and you can't keep it on for a long period of time. If you have a baby sleeping in his/her room and you want to find out if she wakes up and cries you have to keep the video and sound on for hours and it will drain your battery very quickly and also the phone starts heating up.Listen only mode is a simple feature to add and it will minimize the power consumption of the phone as the transmission of sound requires very little use of data bandwidth and therefore battery. In listen only mode you can keep the connection on for a long time and monitor the baby.

I want to keep an eye on my cat and the house while I'm away. Motion detection function is available but only with SD Card inserted. It will also record and save videos to SD card or have video recorded to App album with no SD card. I use it with Wi-Fi only but it will work with mobile data. I like the 2 way audio feature but it freaks out my cat so I don't plan to use much for now. I think my favorite feature is that you can pan the screen vertically and horizontally or 360 \u00b0 and zoom in. It even has 3 shooting angles depending on whether the camera will be used table top, wall or ceiling mount. I was really impressed with all the features included for the low price.
